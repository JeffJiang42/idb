<p style=""color: #282c35; font-family: proxima-nova, sans-serif;"">Our motivation to create Fleetsmith stemmed from our deep frustration with existing computer management solutions.

We bring the product and design focus traditionally only associated with consumer companies to the &ldquo;enterprise software&rdquo; space. We&rsquo;re a company where product comes first, where brand and product are intertwined, and where design is not an afterthought, but is fundamental to the process of building a product our customers love.</p>

7,Client Care Specialist_30374,Precision Nutrition,"<p><p>Do you have the ability to <em>read into</em> a question and really understand what someone is asking? Does &lsquo;making someone's day' get you out of bed in the morning? Do you want to work with a company that really makes a difference in the lives of others?</p>
<p>We are looking for a rockstar Client Care Specialist to join our team and provide superior customer service that exceeds our client's expectations.</p>
<h2>What You'll be Doing</h2>
<p>You get to work from home with an amazing team of Client Care Specialists that care deeply about building and strengthening our client relationships. You will educate clients on our products and respond to tough (and not-so-tough) inquiries through email using Desk.com and on live chat using Intercom.io. You will also make the occasional phone call. Yep, you'll be responding to LOTS of people and putting smiles on their faces all day. That takes a certain kind of person. If that's you...read on.</p>
<h2>Our Ideal Candidate</h2>
<p><strong>Knows their stuff.</strong> This can't be your first rodeo. You have at least 2 years of experience in a web-based, service oriented company providing customer support where email and live chat were your primary responsibilities.</p>
<p><strong>Can read between the lines.</strong>&nbsp;Sometimes a client's question isn't always obvious, and I'm sure you know, a lot can get lost in 'email' translation. A client may be asking for one thing, and really need something else. You have an uncanny ability to read into what they are looking for, ask the right questions, and exceed their expectations by responding to their real question.</p>
<p><strong>Has great sleuthing skills.</strong> You are able to do your own detective work and find clues with the tools you have access to. You never pass on a case without first trying to piece the puzzle together.</p>
<p><strong>Is an exceptional communicator.</strong> You know how to get your message across clearly and concisely to different audiences, through the written word. You are a skilled writer and have outstanding proofreading skills. Yup, you're a natural here.</p>
<p><strong>Embraces sales.</strong>&nbsp;You understand that part of your role is to be a frontline salesperson and you see this as an important part of how you approach your work.</p>
<p><strong>Cares.</strong>&nbsp;You are an empathetic advocate for our clients. You recognize that through email, you are building relationships, making our customers feel cared for, and quickly solving problems if an experience doesn't go 100% as planned. You care about our clients having accurate information and are getting their issues resolved.</p>
<p><strong>Is thorough and obsessed with the details.</strong> You are careful, cautious, and incredibly meticulous; some may even call you nitpicky - in an endearing way, of course! And, you dream about dotting the i's and crossing the t's. Nothing slips by the net when you're goalie.</p>
<p><strong>Is comfortable with frequent pivots.</strong>&nbsp;You have the ability to prioritize and re-prioritize your work in a fast-changing environment - you understand that things change as new information is made available. You don't mind shifting gears and are skilled at having a few balls up in the air at one time.</p>
<p><strong>Is committed to their craft.</strong>&nbsp;You were meant to be in Client Care. It is your unique ability. <em>It's not a stepping stone to join PN or to gain some experience to launch another career</em>. You care about people and want to be sure they have everything they need to make the right decision for themselves and get their questions answered.</p>
<p><strong>Has the ability to work independently and can ramp up quickly, for more intense periods of work.</strong>&nbsp;Once you are confident in what you need to do, you can run with it and don't need a lot of direction. That said, you are not on an island. You'll get plenty of help and support from the team when you need it and when it gets busy during launch periods and the team needs you - you'll jump right in.</p>
<p><strong>Leaves their ego at the door.</strong>&nbsp;You have integrity, talent, are outgoing, have a palpable excitement about the future, and don't show it off. Shadiness, mediocrity, cynicism, and excessive 'constructive criticism' are out.</p>
<p><strong>Wants to be part of a purpose-driven organization.</strong>&nbsp;PN is a pretty incredible place and is committed to allowing you to do the work you love and love the work you do.</p>
<p>Life-changing, research-driven nutrition coaching. That's our mission at Precision Nutrition.</p>
<p>As an organization, we:</p>
<ul>
<li>Seek and support diversity.</li>
<li>Offer 4 weeks paid time-off, benefits, and the ability to work remotely.</li>
<li>Set you up with whatever fancy gear you need to perform at your best.</li>
<li>Give you the flexibility to make your own schedule.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not only that, but if you join us you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Work in the fitness and nutrition industry.</strong> We love exercise, we love nutrition, and we love sport. That's why we started this company. If you do too, you'll appreciate how rare it is to find a career you really love. For active, fit people, Precision Nutrition is that opportunity.</li>
<li><strong>Work with fun, bright, and talented people.</strong> We're a small company, and we're picky about who we work with, because to us, this isn't just a job; it's our life.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you or someone you know is interested in the position we welcome you to apply below. Please <strong>only apply if you are committed to the Client Care field</strong>. Only serious applicants will be considered and not those looking for an opportunity to <em>get into</em> PN.</p></p>",https://d2fcz5no062gar.cloudfront.nethttps://authenticjobs.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/logos/c93a02aefdcef5c3d54be41d4bd142f4/thumb/square logo.png,https://www.precisionnutrition.com/careers,Authentic Jobs,"Other, Sales, Nutrition, Fitness, Industry","218,317,366,401,456,488,525,549,596,598,661,679,696,734,786,792,793,805,807,815,840,879,896,1003,1011,1019,1026,1057,1069,1114,1117,1149,1158,1175,1194,1200,1223,1237,1239,1243,1245,1250,1261,1303,1397,1422,1445,1469,1484,1522,1526,1529,1534,1538,1548,1556,1557,1572,1579,1585,1588,1606,1610,1637,1654,1677,1684,1700,1708,1727,1734,1737,1802,1813,1848,1855,1885,1908,1917,1933,1956,1957,1965,2000,2001,2013,2053,2140,2144,2151,2334,2358,2388,2428,2454,2455,2474,2510,2538,2560,2566,2579,2583,2606,2624,2626,2696,2723,2739","23,78,87,106,118",Anywhere in Canada,Full-time

We&rsquo;re a small bunch so far but we have plans for world domination. We&rsquo;re based in Long Beach, just a Kobe 3-pointer from the beach, and a taxi ride from the heart of LA. We are on the lookout for an individual who seeks a position at the cutting edge of web development. All candidates must work with speed and enjoy sweating over tight deadlines. They must live to code and not be happy until they&rsquo;ve seen a project through from insemination to birth to that first day at kindergarten.</p>
<p><strong>Who are you?</strong> The dude (or dudette) for the role should have a minimum of two years in the world of web development, with a portfolio that&rsquo;s likely to blow our socks off.</p>
<p>Because we live in the virtual world, it does not matter where you reside, as long as you are available during business hours. Still reading?</p>
<p><strong>Can you tick these boxes?</strong></p>
<p>● You are a Wordpress Whiz and have extensive knowledge/experience with front-end work.</p>
<p>● You&rsquo;re a dab hand in JavaScript/jQuery (If you can write plugins as well then that&rsquo;s a bonus, but you must be able to write and implement small-to-medium scripts at least)</p>
<p>● You&rsquo;re an old pro in writing raw HTML and CSS (especially HTML5 and CSS3)</p>
<p>● You are experienced working with PHP tasks</p>
<p>● You&rsquo;re used to developing in a LAMP environment</p>
<p>● You&rsquo;re on-the-button with current Web standards, optimization techniques and best practices</p>
<p>● You&rsquo;re full of knowledge regarding Twitter Bootstrap and Foundation</p>
<p>● You&rsquo;re a web developer with two or more years of professional industry experience</p>
<p><strong>And it goes without saying</strong> You can both talk the talk and walk the walk. You have 20:20 vision when it comes to fine details.

<h3>Company</h3>
<p><a href=""https://common.net/"">Common Networks</a> was founded on the idea that everyone should have a choice for fast, affordabe access to broadband internet. Right now, most homes in the U.S. don't, in fact 62% of homes live in a monopoly broadband market. High-speed access unlocks all the superpowers on the internet. When it works, it can be a great leveling force across the world, giving everyone access to educational tools, entertainment, immediate translations, or even medical care that they wouldn't otherwise have.</p>
<p>Common Networks provides surburban neighborhoods with internet using wireless technology. We interconnect homes in a neighborhood, creating a mesh network between homes and our fiber internet sources. A whole community can then have fast and reliable internet service with only a few&nbsp; locations needing fiber access.</p>
<h3>Role</h3>
<p>We are looking to hire our first Product Designer. The primary function of this role is UX/UI design, but this role will also be flexible to do some visual design and marketing design. As the first designer, you will have heavy influence over our overall brand and product experience. We are seeking a designer who can use design thinking, product design, and visual design to help achieve our company-level goals. We care deeply about our customer experience and believe that crafting and honing this experience is what sets us apart from the incumbent ISPs that exist today.</p>
<h3>What you do</h3>
<ul>
<li>Problem-solve with the product and engineering teams to come up with solutions for problems/challenges across our entire platform</li>
<li>Build designs for products and features for a number of different audiences: internal users, field technicians, and our internet subscribers</li>
<li>Work cross-functionally with engineers, field operations team, and product managers to implement features</li>
<li>You are the voice of design at the company and help to hold us to a high bar of design excellence</li>
</ul>
<h3>Who you are&nbsp;</h3>
<ul>
<li>You care first and foremost about creating an awesome user experience, no matter who the customer is. To that end, you know how to balance aesthetics, functionality and practicality.</li>
<li>Design generalist. Your strength is in UX/UI design, however you can also produce visual designs, build marketing templates, and help us think through industrial design of our hardware.</li>
<li>Collaborative team member.&nbsp; You are open, honest, and can respectfully work through difficult problems with the rest of the team.</li>
<li>Clear communicator. You have many audiences - engineers, designers, operations team, our board of directores, etc. You know how to structure written and verbal communications clearly for each audience.</li>
<li>Creative problem-solver. We are developing technology and a product that has never been built before. You are creative; you generate new, innovative ideas that help us solve problems.</li>
<li>Detail oriented. You sweat the small stuff and don't let things slip through the cracks. You understand the difference between letting something slip through the cracks vs. actively deprioritizing an edge case.</li>
<li>Naturally curious and have a self-starter personality with hustle. You don't need to wait for people to tell you what to work on. You know that done is better than perfect and are engergized by constantly delivering and moving things forward. You roll up your sleeves and do whatever it takes to make things successful.</li>
<li>Flexible and excited to work in a fast paced, rapidly evolving environment.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Qualifications</h3>
<ul>
<li>5+ years of relevant experience</li>

43,Senior Software Engineer JavaScript_30343,Very,"<p><p dir=""ltr"">Interviewing for a new company is a serious time commitment for all parties involved. Please take the time to read this and thoughtfully consider if we would be a good fit for one another. This is a full-time position. You must be located in the continental U.S. No contractors or agencies. Seriously.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Why We Started Very</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Not to oversimplify things, but our mission is to become the best IoT, blockchain, and machine learning product development shop in the world. We do this by hiring the best and investing heavily in them, both personally and professionally.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>We Fully Embrace Working Remotely</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">About 30% of our team works out of our HQ in Chattanooga, TN, and the other 70% work remotely from various locations across the United States. We consider ourselves best-practitioners of the remote-first movement and believe a great team shouldn&rsquo;t be restricted by geography.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>What You&rsquo;ll Be Working On</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Very is first and foremost a software consultancy, we tackle hard problems for clients who need a targeted, senior team to come in and provide specific solutions. We are focusing heavily on building out products that have applications in one of the three following areas: 1) data science &amp; machine learning, 2) Internet of Things, and 3) blockchain. We&rsquo;ve found that in each of these areas, the use of the underlying technology will drive the development of the core services , but that 75% of the work often still lives in the realm of modern web development.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">At Very, there is a never ending supply of variety to the types of projects we work on. In the last year we&rsquo;ve built solutions that touch e-commerce, trust management (finance), beer distribution, point of sale systems, ICO&rsquo;s, identifying fake news, and much more.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">You&rsquo;ll spend 80% of your week (Monday through Thursday) designing and building a product or platform for one of our clients. The other 20% of your week (Friday) will be spent contributing to our open source projects, internal products, learning, teaching, and participating in internal operations of all flavors.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Project teams are small and usually made up of one or two pairs of engineers, a UX engineer, a product manager, and the client who serves as the product owner. We spend most of our time building new products, with the goal of helping our clients take it to market. We are often further engaged by our clients to continue iterating on the product once it is live. The high cost of context switching is real, so we do our best to keep teams together throughout the duration of their projects (typically 3-6 months), but have found it valuable to rotate pairing partners when it makes reasonable sense.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">We are always exploring new tools, languages, and technologies. We feel strongly that it&rsquo;s a good idea to use the best tool for the job and not see everything as a nail. We also try our best to standardize our technology and tooling across project teams so it&rsquo;s easier to rotate and practice collective code ownership. We are currently building products and platforms using the following tools / platforms:</p>
<ul>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr"">React &amp; React Native</p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr"">Swift &amp; Objective C</p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr"">Elixir, Phoenix, and Nerves</p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr"">Arduino (embedded C/C++)</p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr"">Ethereum / Solidity</p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr"">Ruby on Rails</p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr"">Python</p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr"">Pandas</p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr"">Serverless</p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr"">AWS (and a dash of Heroku where it makes sense)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir=""ltr"">Given that we work on quite a bit of greenfield projects, there is often room to experiment with new patterns and tools (within reason). We don&rsquo;t expect applicants to know our entire toolchain, but rather to be capable, flexible, and self-directed.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>This Role: Senior Software Engineer // Javascript</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Over the past few years, we&rsquo;ve seen client-side engineering emerge as its own discipline, and we are looking for individuals who thrive in the front end and want to further their practice. Ideal candidates not only have a solid engineering background, but a passion for client-side development as well.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">We value well-tested, reusable code and expect our engineers to be as good of practitioners as they are leaders and teachers.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>How We Operate</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">We are believers in transparency and openness. In terms of organizational structure and governance, we are a <a rel=""noopener"" href=""http://www.holacracy.org/"" target=""_blank"" data-saferedirecturl=""https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://www.holacracy.org/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1519496955340000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGSQW8VQYShcKfMzJ95qzCzcoiJsg"">holacracy</a>.

We believe in hiring capable, responsible professionals. We don&rsquo;t micromanage and trust everyone to work hard, experiment, learn from their mistakes, and contribute to each other and the company in a sustainable manner. We have no venture funding or external investors, which affords us the ability to be nimble and run our company in the best interest of our team as a whole.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>How You&rsquo;ll Be Compensated</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">We believe in a transparent, fair compensation structure and have developed our own open salary formula. Depending on your skill and experience, you can expect to make somewhere between $80,000 and $135,000 upon joining the company. We have many health plans available through UHC&mdash;prices and plans vary based on your region&mdash;as well as vision and dental. We currently contribute a large portion to each plan, again, amounts vary based on region. As an added benefit, Very provides 1X Earnings Basic Life &amp; AD&amp;D. We have a 401k program that we&rsquo;ll provide a 2% match on after a few months working with us. Lastly, 35% of the company&rsquo;s ownership is reserved for a team member options pool.</p>

<p><strong>Ruby/Rails API development.</strong> Our coaching platform is backed by a RESTful API implemented in Rails. You&rsquo;ll spend a lot of your time building, testing, and working with Rails. We&rsquo;re using Elixir and Phoenix too, so come prepared to learn!</p>
<p><strong>Ember.</strong> Our front-end devs are focused on working with our suite of Ember, user-facing applications - but it really helps if you can see the big picture and understand our stack front to back. That means learning Ember.js and Ember Data. Don&rsquo;t worry - you&rsquo;ll have lots of help. We&rsquo;ve got a team of Ember experts to show you the ropes.</p>
<p><strong>DevOps.</strong> You&rsquo;ll write reliable, scripted means of deploying code and system changes (today we use Ansible, yet we&rsquo;re open to trying new tools). You&rsquo;ll maintain provisioning and continuous integration systems, keep system software up to date, and ensure code can be deployed and rolled back easily and reliably, while making sure backups are behaving, and security best practices are being followed.</p>
<p><strong>Monitor performance.</strong>You&rsquo;ll design and execute performance tests on our website and other applications, as well as recommend and implement system and application performance best practices.</p>
<p><strong>Maintain our systems.</strong> You&rsquo;ll monitor the health of all systems, participate in our on-call rotation team, and respond to, and escalate infrastructure issues. You&rsquo;ll perform regular and ad hoc sysadmin tasks on all shared systems, and manage Amazon Web Services and other hosting service providers. You&rsquo;ll schedule and manage site downtime, and work with the team to proactively add infrastructure so that our clients and team have the best experience possible.</p>
<h2>Our Ideal Candidate</h2>
<p><strong>Is experienced.</strong> You have at least 5 years of experience in a Development or DevOps role in an Agile environment. You know, or are excited to learn, Ruby on Rails, Ember, and maybe even some Elixir/Phoenix, as well as the usual tools of the trade: Amazon Web Services such as EC2, S3 and RDS, Ansible, Vagrant, Linux, PostgreSQL, Continuous Integration, and Redis.</p>
<p><strong>Is on the cutting edge.</strong> In your spare time, you research and stay up to date on the latest and greatest best practices, systems, and tools.</p>
<p><strong>Likes variety.</strong> You'll be wrangling all kinds of systems, apps, and technologies - everything from our Wordpress-based sales sites to our modern Ember/Rails based coaching platform and our next generation Elixir based payment processing system.</p>
<p><strong>Can easily switch gears.</strong> You have the ability to prioritize and re-prioritize your work in a changing environment - you understand that things change as new information is made available. You don&rsquo;t mind managing multiple projects and have the ability to have a few balls up in the air at one time.</p>
<p><strong>Cares.</strong> You take care of our data and systems like they are your very own.</p>
<p><strong>Is self-motivated and can work independently.</strong> Once you are confident in what you need to do, you can run with it and don&rsquo;t need a lot of direction. You are highly organized and always eager to learn more and share with the team.</p>
<p><strong>Leaves their ego at the door.</strong> You have integrity, talent, are outgoing, have a palpable excitement about the future, and don&rsquo;t show it off. Shadiness, mediocrity, cynicism, and excessive ""constructive criticism"" are out.</p>
<p><strong>Is resilient and has a growth mindset.</strong> Part of open, honest communication is having the ability to deliver honest, direct feedback without being offensive or critical. The other part is having the ability to view honest, direct feedback as a gift you can use to get better. If you&rsquo;re married to your ideas or are (even mildly) offended when they&rsquo;re challenged, this probably won&rsquo;t be a good fit for you.</p>
<p><strong>Has worked remotely.</strong> You have strong self-structure and discipline and have worked remotely either currently or in the past so you know the benefits and the challenges.</p>
<p><strong>Wants to be part of a purpose-driven organization.</strong>&nbsp;PN is a pretty incredible place and is committed to allowing you to do the work you love and love the work you do.</p>
<p>Life-changing, research-driven nutrition coaching. That's our mission at Precision Nutrition.</p>
<p>As an organization, we:</p>
<ul>
<li>Seek and support diversity.</li>
<li>Offer 4 weeks paid time-off, benefits, and the ability to work remotely.</li>
<li>Set you up with whatever fancy gear you need to perform at your best.</li>
<li>Give you the flexibility to make your own schedule.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not only that, but if you join us you can:</p>
<p><strong>Work in the fitness and nutrition industry. </strong> We love exercise, we love nutrition, and we love sport. That&rsquo;s why we started this company. If you do too, you&rsquo;ll appreciate how rare it is to find a career you really love. For active, fit people, Precision Nutrition is that opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>Work with fun, bright, and talented people.</strong> We&rsquo;re a small company, and we&rsquo;re picky about who we work with, because to us, this isn&rsquo;t just a job; it&rsquo;s our life.</p>

In addition to making our clients' lives easier through technology, you will also be highly involved in continuously improving the technical strategy of our various lines of business and help&nbsp;shape the overall technical strategy for the organization.</p>
<p style=""color: #333333; font-family: sans-serif, Arial, Verdana, 'Trebuchet MS'; font-size: 14px;"">Your day in the life will be varied. You will work with our business development team to outline viable solutions for potential clients. You will work with established cross-discipline teams as they take your visions and make them their own, while ensuring the deliverables ultimately solve the clients' problems. You will also be expected to share your knowledge with your teammates, mentoring others through the challenges you have previously faced.</p>
<p style=""color: #333333; font-family: sans-serif, Arial, Verdana, 'Trebuchet MS'; font-size: 14px;"">The right candidate will have extensive experience in the trenches, developing custom software solutions for clients. You will be an expert translator, from the clients' high level visions, into low-level technical details, and back. You are the type of person who has a strong desire to sit face-to-face with the client to understand their pain, while also needing to write some code from time-to-time. You understand there are often simple technical solutions to what may seem like unsurmountable problems to our clients. You thrive on making people's lives easier.</p>
<p style=""color: #333333; font-family: sans-serif, Arial, Verdana, 'Trebuchet MS'; font-size: 14px;"">We are a cloud-first shop. You will have extensive knowledge in the full AWS stack. Ideally you&rsquo;ve even jumped through the hoops of being officially certified as an AWS Solutions Architect. Our solutions vary based on the needs of our clients. We tend to develop custom solutions around our clients existing investments in products such as Adobe Experience Manager, Drupal 8, Veeva, Salesforce, and Pardot.&nbsp; Any experience with these platforms would be highly beneficial.</p>
<p style=""color: #333333; font-family: sans-serif, Arial, Verdana, 'Trebuchet MS'; font-size: 14px;"">Our custom solutions are a polyglot approach that may use Java, client and server-side JavaScript, Python, and PHP, depending on the needs of each project. We don&rsquo;t believe in having a client spend more money than necessary, therefore we prefer &ldquo;serverless&rdquo; solutions when appropriate.</p>

52,Sr. Software Engineer Full Stack_30344,Very,"<p><p dir=""ltr"">Interviewing for a new company is a serious time commitment for all parties involved. Please take the time to read this and thoughtfully consider if we would be a good fit for one another. This is a full-time position. You must be located in the continental U.S. No contractors or agencies. Seriously.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Why We Started Very</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Not to oversimplify things, but our mission is to become the best IoT, blockchain, and machine learning product development shop in the world. We do this by hiring the best and investing heavily in them, both personally and professionally.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>We Fully Embrace Working Remotely</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">About 30% of our team works out of our HQ in Chattanooga, TN, and the other 70% work remotely from various locations across the United States. We consider ourselves best-practitioners of the remote-first movement and believe a great team shouldn&rsquo;t be restricted by geography.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>What You&rsquo;ll Be Working On</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Very is first and foremost a software consultancy, we tackle hard problems for clients who need a targeted, senior team to come in and provide specific solutions. We are focusing heavily on building out products that have applications in one of the three following areas: 1) data science &amp; machine learning, 2) Internet of Things, and 3) blockchain. We&rsquo;ve found that in each of these areas, the use of the underlying technology will drive the development of the core services , but that 75% of the work often still lives in the realm of modern web development.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">At Very, there is a never ending supply of variety to the types of projects we work on. In the last year we&rsquo;ve built solutions that touch e-commerce, trust management (finance), beer distribution, point of sale systems, ICO&rsquo;s, identifying fake news, and much more.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">You&rsquo;ll spend 80% of your week (Monday through Thursday) designing and building a product or platform for one of our clients. The other 20% of your week (Friday) will be spent contributing to our open source projects, internal products, learning, teaching, and participating in internal operations of all flavors.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Project teams are small and usually made up of one or two pairs of engineers, a UX engineer, a product manager, and the client who serves as the product owner. We spend most of our time building new products, with the goal of helping our clients take it to market. We are often further engaged by our clients to continue iterating on the product once it is live. The high cost of context switching is real, so we do our best to keep teams together throughout the duration of their projects (typically 3-6 months), but have found it valuable to rotate pairing partners when it makes reasonable sense.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">We are always exploring new tools, languages, and technologies. We feel strongly that it&rsquo;s a good idea to use the best tool for the job and not see everything as a nail. We also try our best to standardize our technology and tooling across project teams so it&rsquo;s easier to rotate and practice collective code ownership. We are currently building products and platforms using the following tools / platforms:</p>
<ul>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr"">React &amp; React Native</p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr"">Swift &amp; Objective C</p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr"">Elixir, Phoenix, and Nerves</p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr"">Arduino (embedded C/C++)</p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr"">Ethereum / Solidity</p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr"">Ruby on Rails</p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr"">Python</p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr"">Pandas</p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr"">Serverless</p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr"">AWS (and a dash of Heroku where it makes sense)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir=""ltr"">Given that we work on quite a bit of greenfield projects, there is often room to experiment with new patterns and tools (within reason). We don&rsquo;t expect applicants to know our entire toolchain, but rather to be capable, flexible, and self-directed.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>This Role: Senior Full-Stack Software Engineer</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">As a full-stack engineer at Very, you will work on a wide variety of projects and stacks. This job is a great fit for pragmatic polyglot programmers with a functional bend. Over the last few years, we&rsquo;ve shipped countless Ruby on Rails projects and are at the tail end of moving to Elixir for the bulk of our services. Additionally, we have a strong Python contingent who are utilizing the serverless framework for the development of highly targeted microservices / systems as well as for data science and machine learning projects.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">We value well-tested, reusable code and expect our engineers to be as good of practitioners as they are leaders and teachers.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>How We Operate</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">We are believers in transparency and openness. In terms of organizational structure and governance, we are a <a rel=""noopener"" href=""http://www.holacracy.org/"" target=""_blank"" data-saferedirecturl=""https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://www.holacracy.org/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1519496955340000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGSQW8VQYShcKfMzJ95qzCzcoiJsg"">holacracy</a>.

We believe in hiring capable, responsible professionals. We don&rsquo;t micromanage and trust everyone to work hard, experiment, learn from their mistakes, and contribute to each other and the company in a sustainable manner. We have no venture funding or external investors, which affords us the ability to be nimble and run our company in the best interest of our team as a whole.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>How You&rsquo;ll Be Compensated</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">We believe in a transparent, fair compensation structure and have developed our own open salary formula. Depending on your skill and experience, you can expect to make somewhere between $80,000 and $135,000 upon joining the company. We have many health plans available through UHC&mdash;prices and plans vary based on your region&mdash;as well as vision and dental. We currently contribute a large portion to each plan, again, amounts vary based on region. As an added benefit, Very provides 1X Earnings Basic Life &amp; AD&amp;D. We have a 401k program that we&rsquo;ll provide a 2% match on after a few months working with us. Lastly, 35% of the company&rsquo;s ownership is reserved for a team member options pool.</p></p>",https://d2fcz5no062gar.cloudfront.net/assets/images/defaults/company-blank.png,https://authenticjobs.com/apply/30344,Authentic Jobs,"Web Development, Other, Data & Analytics, Finance, Management, Operations, E-Commerce, Google","215,216,217,219,224,229,230,233,237,240,241,259,263,265,269,272,273,277,281,282,286,295,302,305,306,310,320,322,326,330,338,340,348,355,358,359,361,365,373,380,390,396,399,408,413,417,418,421,427,430,438,449,450,460,474,480,485,490,497,502,544,546,554,561,568,570,590,593,608,611,618,641,647,691,716,723,726,736,755,756,771,773,774,784,816,829,848,865,869,878,881,884,913,915,918,922,926,950,954,957,968,976,977,986,993,1036,1037,1050,1054,1058,1085,1086,1090,1098,1102,1103,1112,1119,1131,1138,1143,1146,1168,1170,1172,1174,1183,1202,1203,1206,1207,1227,1229,1235,1247,1263,1277,1283,1284,1295,1315,1319,1328,1362,1363,1367,1372,1379,1384,1388,1406,1409,1414,1418,1439,1441,1462,1491,1553,1560,1561,1581,1583,1594,1617,1630,1631,1634,1644,1648,1690,1693,1695,1697,1721,1725,1733,1746,1749,1771,1777,1798,1819,1825,1830,1834,1852,1859,1877,1881,1886,1889,1921,1928,1929,1937,1938,1939,1946,1954,1961,1969,1983,1987,1994,2026,2027,2029,2048,2051,2063,2064,2083,2094,2105,2108,2119,2132,2136,2137,2155,2157,2159,2170,2174,2175,2176,2183,2200,2204,2206,2209,2211,2234,2235,2238,2248,2255,2256,2264,2285,2299,2304,2312,2346,2349,2356,2366,2367,2386,2391,2399,2413,2415,2417,2449,2465,2470,2472,2488,2489,2512,2517,2522,2528,2530,2532,2545,2549,2553,2554,2582,2592,2617,2628,2629,2635,2641,2646,2658,2661,2663,2667,2690,2714,2715,2721,2726,2733,2734,2742,2746,2763","22,23,27,32,56,100,103,135","Remote or Chattanooga, TN",Full-time

Your portfolio is a collection of stories that you can discuss with enthusiasm, and regret … because you’re always getting better at what you do and you’re never satisfied with ‘good enough’. You’re excited about the endless potential of the web and being able to build things that millions of people can use every day.</p>

That doesn't just take the combined efforts of user experience and visual designers but also the designers who build the interactions. UX Engineers bring designs to life and sweat every detail. They focus on adding animations and details to interfaces not to just delight users but to improve their understanding of what the UI is doing. At Maark we believe this role is extremely important to creating the best possible experience for our clients and their customers.</p>

This is primarily a development role and will work closely with the engineering team as well. As part of the design process you will translate concepts into prototypes to test potential animations, interactions, design details, and feedback mechanisms. As a team we all try to keep up on the design industry and we'd look to you to contribute input on trends and new ways for users to interact with devices and interfaces.</p>

On top of that, the clients we work with range from large financial institutions to telecoms to hospitality to bio-engineering &mdash; we love learning new subjects and researching our clients' businesses and look to work with people who are just as naturally curious.</p>

60,Web Designer_30330,"Speak Creative, LLC","Speak Creative is an established company of 34 with offices in Memphis and Nashville with a strong remote team across the US. We are skilled in all things interactive, from website design andÃÂÃÂ development to mobile apps and digital marketing. WeÃÂÃÂ create, code, consult, support, sell and most of all problem solve for clients all over the nation.ÃÂÃÂ 
We are looking to add a Web Designer to our Creative Team who has the ability to design and build beautiful websites for our clients through creative visual design and front-end development. We are a multi-disciplinary team with a goal to help serve our clients with powerful, beautiful and functional websites that grow their business. We are driven by design, smart development, data, research and a continually renewed process to help us work more intelligently each and every day.
Some of the skills required:

Well experienced in the AdobeÃÂÃÂ design tools (PS, AI, ID, Xd)
Comfortable writing HTML(5), CSS(3), Javascript by hand
Experienced with CSS scripting languages (we use SASS)
Good understanding of HTML Frameworks (we have our own)
Comfortable working in Flexbox

Some of the characteristics we are looking for:


You can communicateÃÂÃÂ - You donÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂt need to give big presentations, but you should be able to speak clearly and confidently about your work and approach. We are looking for designers who can communicate creative ideas while maintaining their charm.

You are composedÃÂÃÂ - We need someone who is comfortable managing multiple projects at once with sometimes tight turnaround times - all while keeping cool and composed.

You love to helpÃÂÃÂ - You love helping others and can give your time and knowledge generously to help us grow and become better each week.


You solve problemsÃÂÃÂ - YouÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂre a strategic thinker and you can solve problems quickly to help relieve business problems.


You're a designer firstÃÂÃÂ - You consider yourself a designer first, and you can deliver fresh, modern design solutions that stand out on the web.


You're a developer secondÃÂÃÂ - You will also be required to code your own designs. YouÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂll need to be comfortable writing HTML, CSS, andÃÂÃÂ enough JS to toggle a class.


As a company, we value:
Stability


We are (and have been) profitable.


We are (and have been) debt-free.


We own our building in Memphis.


We have a single owner and donÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂt have to worry about partners who split.


Our business is spread out across hundreds of customers instead of a few big fish.


To date, weÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂve never let anyone go for financial reasons.


Work/Life Balance


WeÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂre a team with a focus on doing outstanding work for our clients AND maintaining our sanity.


We work hard during business hours (M-Th 7a-5p and F 7a-11aÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¦yes, every Friday is a half-day!) and go home when work is done.


Rarely, if ever, do we find ourselves staying late or working weekends. Funny what you can get done when you work hard.


Team Participation


We expect everyone on our team to be part of shaping our future. If thereÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs an issue, we tackle it together. If thereÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs an idea, we develop it together.


We meet regularly for fun and creative team building.


Christian Values
Our owner is a believer in Jesus Christ and submits to Biblical authority in leading the company. What does that mean for you? Simply that you can expect to see values like hard work, strong ethics, excellence, grace and others at the core of decision making. Do you have to be a Christian? Absolutely not.",https://d2fcz5no062gar.cloudfront.nethttps://authenticjobs.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/logos/9wv4mdpo19a9xx5bvh2g8k6gvinofnui/thumb/speak logo black.jpg,https://speakcreative.bamboohr.com/jobs/view.php?id=27,Authentic Jobs,"Other, Data & Analytics, Mobile Apps, Web Design, Digital Marketing, Design Tools","218,317,366,401,456,488,525,549,596,598,661,679,696,734,786,792,793,805,807,815,840,879,896,1003,1011,1019,1026,1057,1069,1114,1117,1149,1158,1175,1194,1200,1223,1237,1239,1243,1245,1250,1261,1303,1397,1422,1445,1469,1484,1522,1526,1529,1534,1538,1548,1556,1557,1572,1579,1585,1588,1606,1610,1637,1654,1677,1684,1700,1708,1727,1734,1737,1802,1813,1848,1855,1885,1908,1917,1933,1956,1957,1965,2000,2001,2013,2053,2140,2144,2151,2334,2358,2388,2428,2454,2455,2474,2510,2538,2560,2566,2579,2583,2606,2624,2626,2696,2723,2739","23,27,31,44,48,67","Memphis / Nashville, TN - Remote US Only",Full-time

<p>Devoted Health is a new health care company looking to improve the lives of seniors in America. We are guided by a deep belief that every senior should be treated like we would treat our own family members: with loving care and a profound commitment to their health and well-being.  With aging demographics and rising health costs, this is an industry and problem space that needs today’s best talent working on solutions with high integrity and a long term view. We will improve the lives of seniors by helping them navigate the health care system, by utilizing world-class technology and data to enable a simplified experience, by partnering with top providers for better health outcomes. We are building a stellar team to drive towards our starting point goal to launch a Medicare Advantage plan and clinical services in 2019.</p>

<p><strong>Why Devoted:</strong></p>

<p>Make a difference... a big difference. You will have the opportunity, in a unique and dynamic culture, to be a part of something incredibly meaningful. We’re a disruptive startup with an inspiring mission. Learn and grow alongside our world-class team of health care, technology, and data leaders, dedicated to building a health plan and clinical services that care for everyone like they were our own mothers or fathers. Our team and board members have decades of experience in health care entrepreneurship, data, technology, services, and policy. With their support, we look forward to building a health plan and clinical services that will give seniors easy access to the high-quality care they deserve.</p>

<p><strong>A bit more about this role:</strong></p>

<p>Technology does amazing things in our daily lives, yet often is a source of pain and confusion within health care.  We want to empower Devoted to deliver a world-class member experience with simple, flexible technical systems.  If we need to delve into the murky underbelly of health care IT to do that, we’re up for the challenge.  </p>

<p>Our north star is not a specific technology, but rather the goal of continually increasing the leverage of every member of the team. We’re currently building with Go, PostgreSQL, gRPC, GraphQL, React, TypeScript, Terraform, and AWS, and we think it’s a pretty awesome stack.</p>

<p>We want engineer-owners with the judgment to simultaneously solve for short and long-term business value.  We’re looking for folks who have worked in complex domains and systems, and come through it with some wisdom but most importantly humility.  We want people who are passionate about building great technology to solve problems for users—our members, our colleagues, and ourselves.</p>

<p>Whether you have a health care background or not, we are excited to learn from and share knowledge with you.  Our engineering leadership team includes seasoned alumni of health care and technology organizations spanning the public and private sector.  Our co-founders deeply understand and care about good technology:  Todd Park co-founded Athenahealth, a multi-billion-dollar health care technology company, and served as CTO of the U.S.; Ed Park was Athenahealth's founding engineer and served as its CTO, COO, and President of Services.</p>

<p><strong>Responsibilities will include:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Building product features across a range of technologies</li>
<li>Working with subject matter experts to understand and design solutions to improve our members lives</li>
<li>Working with other members of the technology team to improve our technology platform</li>
</ul><p><strong>Attributes to success:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Experience coupled with a willingness to learn new things</li>
<li>Comfort with uncertainty and a desire to be close to business problems</li>
<li>Desire to contribute individually, with the ability both to self-direct work and to collaborate with others on the technology team</li>
<li>Understanding of many technologies down to first principles, and a desire to add more to the list</li>
</ul><p><strong>Desired skills and experience:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>5+ years working as an individual technical contributor</li>
<li>Experience with our specific stack components a bonus but not required</li>
<li>Bonus: Prior backgrounds in product management, UX or data science; we often ask folks to wear more than one hat</li>

<p>Jane Street is a proprietary quantitative trading firm, focusing primarily on trading equities and equity derivatives. We use innovative technology, a scientific approach, and a deep understanding of markets to stay successful in our highly competitive field. We operate around the clock and around the globe, employing over 500 people in offices in New York, London and Hong Kong.</p>

<p>The markets in which we trade change rapidly, but our intellectual approach changes faster still. Every day, we have new problems to solve and new theories to test. Our entrepreneurial culture is driven by our talented team of traders and programmers. At Jane Street, we don't come to work wanting to leave. We come to work excited to test new theories, have thought-provoking discussions, and maybe sneak in a game of ping-pong or two. Keeping our culture casual and our employees happy is of paramount importance to us.</p>

<p>We are looking to hire great software developers with an interest in functional programming. OCaml, a statically typed functional programming language with similarities to Haskell, Scheme, Erlang, F# and SML, is our language of choice. We've got the largest team of OCaml developers in any industrial setting, and probably the world's largest OCaml codebase. We use OCaml for running our entire business, supporting everything from research to systems administration to trading systems. If you're interested in seeing how functional programming plays out in the real world, there's no better place.</p>

<p>The atmosphere is informal and intellectual. There is a focus on education, and people learn about software and trading, both through formal classes and on the job. The work is challenging, and you get to see the practical impact of your efforts in quick and dramatic terms. Jane Street is also small enough that people have the freedom to get involved in many different areas of the business. Compensation is highly competitive, and there's a lot of room for growth.</p>

<p>You can learn more about Jane Street and our technology from our main site, janestreet.com. You can also look at a a talk given at CMU about why Jane Street uses functional programming (<a href=""http://ocaml.janestreet.com/?q=node/61"">http://ocaml.janestreet.com/?q=node/61</a>), and our programming blog (<a href=""http://ocaml.janestreet.com"">http://ocaml.janestreet.com</a>).</p>

<p>Because we’re in the middle of a complete replatforming, we’re supporting multiple legacy environments while a separate department (Software Engineering) builds the new one. Each time Software Engineering completes a component of the new platform, Production Engineering partners with them to ensure launch readiness and do the actual launch, and then takes over the maintenance and enhancement of that component. This role can be remote.</p>

<p>About You</p>

<p>You seek out worthwhile challenges, thrive in complexity, and find satisfaction in making complicated things simpler. Your technical depth is matched by your depth of character; nothing is ever “someone else’s problem” to you. Your teammates can always count on you in a pinch; you exhibit grace under pressure. You’re always learning and always improving. You let nothing stand in your way because success is the only option when serving the greater good.</p>

<p>About the Technology</p>

<p>New Environment</p>

<p>Angular 4+, and therefore TypeScript</p>

<p>Modern RESTful services built with .NET Core 2+, C#, and OAuth 2 / OpenID, all running on a PaaS and not tied to any particular OS</p>

<p>MEAN (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js) running on a PaaS</p>

<p>Python (with Django and Celery), RabbitMQ, and PostgreSQL, all running on Linux VMs</p>

<p>Both environments</p>

<p>Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services</p>

<p>Serverless: Azure Functions and AWS Lambda</p>

<p>PaaS: Azure Web Apps and AWS Elastic Beanstalk</p>

<p>IaaS: Azure Virtual Machines, AWS EC2 instances, and various other services</p>

<p>Atlassian: JIRA, Confluence, Bitbucket, and Bamboo</p>

<p>Requirements</p>

<p>C# expertise. We’re also open to candidates who are strong in another language and interested in switching.</p>

<p>Solid understanding of REST, HTTP, and Internet/web/cloud fundamentals.</p>

<p>Familiarity with relational databases and SQL.</p>

<p>Familiarity with JavaScript (especially TypeScript and Angular), HTML, and CSS.</p>

<p>Extraordinary attention to detail.</p>

<p>Excellent written, verbal, and visual communication skills.</p>

<p>Expertise in anything listed under “Legacy Environments” above is a plus.</p>

<p>On-call duty, but don’t worry, we get it. The leadership of New Classrooms includes a recovering former Google SRE. We respect your time.</p>

<p>Interest in education technology or education reform, required</p>

Bowery is growing food for a better future by revolutionizing agriculture. Our modern farming company combines the benefits of the best local farms with advances made possible by technology to grow post-organic produce you can feel good about eating. BoweryOS, our proprietary software system, uses vision systems, automation technology, and machine learning to monitor plants and all the variables that drive their growth 24/7. Because we control the entire process from seed to store, Bowery farms use zero pesticides, 95% less water, and are 100+ times more productive on the same footprint of land than traditional agriculture. Bowery produce is currently available at select Whole Foods and Foragers stores in the Tristate area, and featured on the menus of Tom Colicchio’s New York restaurants Craft and Temple Court. Based in New York City, the company has raised $27.5M from leading investors including General Catalyst, GGV Capital, GV (formerly Google Ventures) and First Round Capital.</p>

104,Experienced Mobile Engineer,Loco2,"<p>Loco2's mission is to make booking trains anywhere in Europe as easy and affordable as possible, from epic international adventures to everyday local commutes. Our booking coverage is unrivalled and growing.</p>

<p>We're looking for an experienced mobile engineer to join our growing engineering team. You will help us deliver a world-class mobile experience through our hybrid iOS app, combining fully native views with our Single Page Application (see below).</p>

<p>At Loco2 we care deeply about building an inclusive, open and supportive work environment. We behave with respect for people and the planet and are seeking a diverse range of candidates that share these values.</p>

<p><strong>About us</strong></p>

<p>We're a <a href=""https://loco2.com/team"">small, passionate and cosmopolitan team</a>, with a healthy remote-first culture and an office in London. Our success is built on trust, empathy and shared knowledge, with our users at the centre of what we do. <a href=""https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/loco2.com"">We're proud to have an average rating of 9.3 out of 10 on Trustpilot</a> after 22,000 reviews.</p>

<p>We’ve been selling tickets since 2012 (read our <a href=""https://loco2.com/our-story"">full story here</a>), and we’re growing rapidly as the business matures. Our goal is to scale effectively whilst continuing to delight our users.</p>

<p><strong>Tech stack and role description</strong></p>

<p>Our current mobile applications are <a href=""https://m.signalvnoise.com/hybrid-development-is-how-we-give-our-teams-of-three-superpowers-2021a84437d"">hybrid</a>, mixing fully native views with numerous embedded web-views, presenting parts of our mobile website.</p>

<p>We’re sticking with the hybrid approach (i.e. we don’t intend to ever have fully native apps) but are now transitioning our traditional multi-page web application to a React-powered single-page application. We’re <a href=""https://loco2.com/en/careers/web-developer"">hiring separately for experienced front-end developers</a> to accelerate this transition.</p>

<p>Once we’ve transitioned to the SPA, lots of functionality/UX will be identical across our mobile website and applications, but there remain areas where we’ll need to use native functionality. One of Loco2’s main goals is to be useful to customers when they are travelling, and building an exceptional mobile UX that feels truly native is one of our biggest goals for 2018.</p>

<p>Whilst we don’t expect you to be a master of all of the following technologies, our current software stack consists of:</p>

<ul>
<li>A hybrid iOS app written in Swift</li>
<li>A hybrid Android app written in Kotlin</li>
<li>A traditional multi-page web application written in Ruby on Rails, using CoffeeScript and SCSS</li>
<li>A Ruby library for communicating with train booking APIs</li>
<li>AWS hosted Docker infrastructure, with continuous delivery</li>
</ul><p><strong>About you</strong></p>

<p>An ideal candidate:</p>

<ul>
<li>Has 3+ years of professional mobile application development experience</li>
<li>Solid experience with native iOS development</li>
<li>Takes pride in their craft and adheres to industry best practices such as testing, code linting, peer review and clean modular maintainable code</li>
<li>Has a keen appetite for self-improvement and growth, but doesn't hesitate to ask for help when needed</li>
<li>Strives to discover and understand the root cause of problems, suggesting new and improved solutions, rather than treating the symptoms</li>
<li>Is fluent in English and confident communicating and sharing complex information and learnings with both technical and non-technical team members</li>
<li>Can work hours that have some overlap with London daytime</li>
<li>Is motivated by Loco2's mission</li>

<p>As a recognized leader in disciplined agile and lean software development practices, Pivotal combines the Silicon Valley state of mind, modern approach, and infrastructure with organizations’ core expertise and values. Our cloud-native platform and suite of data tools drive software innovation for many of the world’s most admired brands, helping enterprises move at start-up speeds and with greater business agility. We optimize for change and teach next-generation developers to create and build new solutions, and are committed to open source and open standards.</p>

<p>Our methodology is about evolving, in both development and innovation, and our culture is empowering. Our 2,000+ employees across offices worldwide subscribe to an ethos of kindness. We make a point to bring empathy to each and every project, and are guided by a purposeful mission—to transform how the world builds software.</p>

<p><strong>You</strong></p>

<p>You have a passion for developing large distributed systems to manage data. You understand that software that manages data at scale is a little different from other kinds of systems. Solutions that work fine on single nodes with gigabytes of data can fall over when scaled to petabytes of data and thousands of nodes. You relish discovering solutions that perform at scale while preserving the sanctity of customer data. You are curious, love to learn, and love to share your latest discoveries. Above all, you love shipping software as a member of a collaborative team.</p>

<p><strong>Us</strong></p>

<p>Pivotal Greenplum tackles the technical challenges that come with massively parallel distributed systems operating on petabytes of data across thousands of nodes. We delve into areas like query optimization, high-performance in-memory transaction and query processing, parallel and distributed execution of advanced data processing algorithms, resource management, and storage. On this team, you'll be working on hard, worthwhile problems with a collaborative team, accelerating your growth as an engineer.</p>

<p><strong>Your Day</strong></p>

<p>To make sure you start your day energized, we provide a catered breakfast every weekday morning, and unlimited snacks/drinks are available all day. After breakfast, the office has a daily standup as part of our Agile methodology. You will then spend much of your day pair programming in a test-driven-development method. The work culture is highly collaborative. You will have an hour lunch each day, and you'll find that we do a great job of keeping a sustainable workweek, where people leave promptly at the end of the day; we don't work long hours. Our collaborative, open-plan office space is filled with talented, like-minded engineers who enjoy taking advantage of our weekly Tech Talks, yoga classes, playing ping pong, board games and hanging out with their co-workers.</p>

115,Sr. Software Engineer -- Full Stack,Very LLC,"<p>Interviewing for a new company is a serious time commitment for all parties involved. Please take the time to read this and thoughtfully consider if we would be a good fit for one another. This is a full-time position. You must be located in the continental U.S. No contractors or agencies. Seriously. </p>

<p><strong>Why We Started Very</strong></p>

<p>Not to oversimplify things, but our mission is to become the best IoT, blockchain, and machine learning product development shop in the world. We do this by hiring the best and investing heavily in them, both personally and professionally.</p>

<p><strong>We Fully Embrace Working Remotely</strong></p>

<p>About 30% of our team works out of our HQ in Chattanooga, TN, and the other 70% work remotely from various locations across the United States. We consider ourselves best-practitioners of the remote-first movement and believe a great team shouldn’t be restricted by geography.</p>

<p><strong>What You’ll Be Working On</strong></p>

<p>Very is first and foremost a software consultancy, we tackle hard problems for clients who need a targeted, senior team to come in and provide specific solutions. We are focusing heavily on building out products that have applications in one of the three following areas: 1) data science &amp; machine learning, 2) Internet of Things, and 3) blockchain. We’ve found that in each of these areas, the use of the underlying technology will drive the development of the core services , but that 75% of the work often still lives in the realm of modern web development.</p>

<p>At Very, there is a never ending supply of variety to the types of projects we work on. In the last year we’ve built solutions that touch e-commerce, trust management (finance), beer distribution, point of sale systems, ICO’s, identifying fake news, and much more.</p>

<p>You’ll spend 80% of your week (Monday through Thursday) designing and building a product or platform for one of our clients. The other 20% of your week (Friday) will be spent contributing to our open source projects, internal products, learning, teaching, and participating in internal operations of all flavors. </p>

<p>Project teams are small and usually made up of one or two pairs of engineers, a UX engineer, a product manager, and the client who serves as the product owner. We spend most of our time building new products, with the goal of helping our clients take it to market. We are often further engaged by our clients to continue iterating on the product once it is live. The high cost of context switching is real, so we do our best to keep teams together throughout the duration of their projects (typically 3-6 months), but have found it valuable to rotate pairing partners when it makes reasonable sense. </p>

<p>We are always exploring new tools, languages, and technologies. We feel strongly that it’s a good idea to use the best tool for the job and not see everything as a nail. We also try our best to standardize our technology and tooling across project teams so it’s easier to rotate and practice collective code ownership. We are currently building products and platforms using the following tools / platforms:</p>

<ul>
<li>React &amp; React Native</li>
<li>Swift &amp; Objective C</li>
<li>Elixir,  Phoenix, and Nerves</li>
<li>Arduino (embedded C/C++)</li>
<li>Ethereum / Solidity</li>
<li>Ruby on Rails</li>
<li>Python</li>
<li>Pandas</li>
<li>Serverless</li>
<li>AWS (and a dash of Heroku where it makes sense)</li>
</ul><p>Given that we work on quite a bit of greenfield projects, there is often room to experiment with new patterns and tools (within reason). We don’t expect applicants to know our entire toolchain, but rather to be capable, flexible, and self-directed.</p>

<p><strong>This Role: Senior Full-Stack Software Engineer</strong></p>

<p>As a full-stack engineer at Very, you will work on a wide variety of projects and stacks. This job is a great fit for pragmatic polyglot programmers with a functional bend. Over the last few years, we’ve shipped countless Ruby on Rails projects and are at the tail end of moving to Elixir for the bulk of our services. Additionally, we have a strong Python contingent who are utilizing the serverless framework for the development of highly targeted microservices / systems as well as for data science and machine learning projects.</p>

<p>We value well-tested, reusable code and expect our engineers to be as good of practitioners as they are leaders and teachers. </p>

<p><strong>How We Operate</strong></p>

<p>We are believers in transparency and openness. In terms of organizational structure and governance, we are a holacracy. It’s worked pretty well for the us the last few years. When it comes to development processes, we do our best to adhere as closely to Extreme Programming as possible. We believe in hiring capable, responsible professionals. We don’t micromanage and trust everyone to work hard, experiment, learn from their mistakes, and contribute to each other and the company in a sustainable manner. We have no venture funding or external investors, which affords us the ability to be nimble and run our company in the best interest of our team as a whole.   </p>

<p><strong>How You’ll Be Compensated</strong></p>

<p>We believe in a transparent, fair compensation structure and have developed our own open salary formula. Depending on your skill and experience, you can expect to make somewhere between $80,000 and $135,000 upon joining the company. We have many health plans available through UHC—prices and plans vary based on your region—as well as vision and dental. We currently contribute a large portion to each plan, again, amounts vary based on region.  As an added benefit, Very provides 1X Earnings Basic Life &amp; AD&amp;D. We have a 401k program that we’ll provide a 2% match on after a few months working with us. Lastly, 35% of the company’s ownership is reserved for a team member options pool.</p>",http://github-jobs.s3.amazonaws.com/39840ce2-18b5-11e8-90d0-e77517e96327.png,http://jobs.github.com/positions/5fb0f844-18b5-11e8-9060-a6cd38ce583f,Github Jobs,"Core Finance, Web Development, Programming Languages, Personal Finance, Data & Analytics, Operating Systems, Finance, Project Management, Software Testing, Development Tools, Web Design, Software Engineering, Management, Motivation, Productivity, Design Tools, Production, Sales, Test Taking Skills, Teaching Tools, Operations, E-Commerce, Fitness, Other Programming, Product Marketing","144,145,146,147,148,149,150,151,152,153","14,22,24,26,27,30,32,37,40,41,44,45,56,60,63,67,76,78,89,98,100,103,106,108,122","Chattanooga, TN",Full Time

120,Global Head of Data,Lazada Services SEA,"<p>The role
Summary:
Take ownership, train and grow the data engineering and statistical learning (""data science"") team of the largest Logistics company in South East Asia, covering a population three times the size of US’. We are headquartered above Tanjong Pagar in Singapore, with a great view and year round warm weather.</p>

<p>Situation:
Alibaba Group has injected two billion dollars into Lazada Group, a South East Asian conglomerate whose logistics arm, Lazada eLogistics (LeL), provides end to end logistics services and acts as a logistics marketplace.</p>

<p>LeL is a data driven business, but the data function is still embryonic. Our CEO and CTO themselves are pushing for the creation of a dedicated data engineering and data science team to take its place at the centre of the company. </p>

<p>A data warehouse project has begun, with 20 systems' backend databases replicated hourly or live into a multi-TB PostgreSQL instance. A ""clean"" (normalised) schema is created from it, a set of views that organises the data into a form that represents the real logic of the business cross-systems. The ""raw"" schema contains all the replicated databases, the ""logical"" schema contains the cross-system normalised information, and we're now building the part that gets from the first to the second. The result will be one of the largest <em>relational</em> PostgreSQL deployment in the world.</p>

<p>The next compulsory steps will be:</p>

<ul>
<li>To complete writing the raw-to-logical mapping, thus modelling and implementing a clean view of all the company's information.</li>
<li>To assist, train, mentor and otherwise lead the existing team into completing the mapping.</li>
<li>To replicate the functional spec of all existing data products within the company (mostly reports).</li>
<li>To expand the team to cover skillsets not currently present or trainable.</li>
<li>To build and provide the ability for the team to answer any question from any part of the business promptly and correctly (such as ""what is the average time a package between 2 and 5kg spends being picked in cold storage zones between 9 and 11am in Thailand and Myanmar a week after Chinese New Year"").</li>
</ul><p>Optional paths thereafter could be:</p>

<ul>
<li>To assist the CEO and CTO with their existing statistical learning projects, such as optimising the routing of millions of packages through multiple transport companies and warehouses internationally.</li>
<li>To think of, develop and deploy other data-driven projects such as optimising warehouse picking operations or inventory management.</li>
<li>To train local teams capable of doing the same independently, and support their efforts. This involves travelling around Asia.</li>
</ul><p>Likely useful experience:</p>

<ul>
<li>Software development (aside from building actual software, you'll need to read a lot of code to understand systems whose logic is not at database level).</li>
<li>A mathematical bend, including awareness of and respect for the ideas behind the relational model (""predicate logic on sets"") as defined by Edgar Codd and Chris Date, and rich data types. If you see a foreign key as a mathematical domain and think in terms of relation values and variables, we are probably on the same page.</li>
<li>Knowing your way around PostgreSQL, or failing that any large scale RDBMS deployment; there are infrastructure teams and DBAs but they need your guidance.</li>
<li>At least some enjoyment of the resolution of large, complex problems using more abstract methods as opposed to quick hacks and duct tape.</li>
<li>UNIX/Linux, but if you've read that far you probably have more than enough experience. </li>
<li>Speaking Chinese (Mandarin) may help a bit but the team has multiple native speakers.</li>
</ul><p>Interview process:</p>

<ul>
<li>Email <a href=""mailto:vanessa.tan@lazada.com"">vanessa.tan@lazada.com</a> to be sent a few quick questions. Include ""6h9mYszLTq2Y"" in the subject line so we know you're not a bot.</li>
<li>An hour or two over Skype for probing your technical experience.</li>
<li>An hour or two in Singapore (if you are there) or over Skype for the C-levels to figure out if they can work with you.</li>

128,Senior Software Engineer (Full stack),Grove Collaborative,"<p><strong>About Us</strong></p>

<p>Grove Collaborative is a digitally native brand and direct-to-consumer e-commerce platform for natural home and personal care products. With a mission to help every family create a healthy, beautiful home, Grove offers a flexible recurring shipment model and gives each customer a personal shopper, a “Grove Guide.”</p>

<p><strong><em>What makes us different</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>We are a B Corp</strong>
We are a B Corp - a group of about 2500 companies (like Patagonia and Ben &amp; Jerry's) that prioritize social &amp; environmental impact as well as profits (do we need “as well as profits”?). We can only do well if our community, environment, employees, and customers do well too.</p>

<p><strong>We have to engineer to move physical product; which is hard! And fun!</strong>
Scaling our technology doesn't just mean more users online, but also shipping and managing physical product at scale. Ever tried optimizing order routing across a network of distribution centers to minimize order splitting? Here's your chance.</p>

<p><strong>We sell real things to real people, and make an impact</strong>
We’re not selling to Silicon Valley &amp; New York; Our customers are real families across the United States. We’ve helped hundreds of thousands of families (households?) make better decisions, and use more sustainable products.</p>

<p><strong>We ship code to production every day</strong>
We believe the key to development speed lies in automation, testing, and incremental change (incremental change, testing, and automation [it sounds better in this order to me]). Code isn't adding value if it's sitting in a branch; we are optimized to get to production and make an impact.</p>

<p><strong>We are in a truly massive market</strong>
Laundry detergent alone is a $130bn global market. And there's been little innovation in the past decade. Across consumer goods, it's the same products, sold at the same brick &amp; mortar grocery stores. We can do better for our customers, and for the world.</p>

<p><strong>Our Engineering Team</strong>
Our engineering team of 12 (10 in San Francisco) works primarily in Python (we have Django, Flask, and, command line applications) and ES6 + vue on the front end. On any given day, you’ll find engineers collaborating to track down the source of a strange pattern in our metrics, pair programming on a piece of brand new functionality, heads-down on a challenging refactor, or meeting with other departments to understand the business context for what we’re building. We are looking for exceptional developers to take on big challenges, and innovate with our fast growing team.</p>

<p><strong>The Role</strong></p>

<p>As a full stack developer on the team, you will have a hand in defining the technology that runs grove.co. You will join a team of world class, highly motivated software engineers to deliver a high quality software architecture with the scalability, maintainability, and performance needed to match the staggering growth of our company (5x year-over-year). You love finding practical solutions to problems, that will grow with the company and a proven ability to design, develop, and ship software that customers love.</p>

<p><strong>Your Impact</strong></p>

<p>Work on the core aspects of the Grove.co, allowing our services to perform effectively, efficiently, reliably and with high scalability
Collaborate closely with other engineers to create solid, robust code
Ship high-value features and own the impact of your solutions
Work with product managers to brainstorm and create products that are loved by our customers
Advocate for new and better ways we should develop, and discover and implement new best practices for the development organization
Build frameworks and tools that are used by our customers and internal organizations
Contribute back to the open source projects we rely on</p>

<p><strong>About You</strong></p>

<p>3+ years of strong Python, SQL &amp; Javascript development experience
Note that if you have relevant ecommerce experience, but in a different stack, we still want to talk!
You love clean code and robust design
You value and take responsibility for the quality of your features, including writing your own tests (unit, functional and integration) and reviewing your teammates’ code
Keen nose for bad code smells
Motivated and assertive in learning and helping your team be successful
Innovator with good ideas, strong problem solving abilities, and a results oriented attitude
Strong communication and collaboration skills</p>

<p><strong>Our Office</strong></p>

<p>Our office doesn't have nerf guns and we celebrate real revenue milestones, not fundraising goals. We also have:</p>

<ul>
<li>A beautifully designed open office Located at Polk &amp; Pine St in San Francisco near lots of delicious cafes &amp; restaurants</li>

135,Senior Software Engineer,Stride Consulting,"<p>Join our Family </p>

<p>Stride Consulting is a mission-driven, engineering-centric company. We seek developers who place a high value on continuous learning, and value diversity. If you consider yourself a non-dogmatic engineer, have a thirst for learning, and an eye for process, you’re in great company. </p>

<p>Our goal is to leave our clients functioning at a higher level than when we found them.  We do this by writing high quality code alongside them, and by mentoring their developers, product teams and stakeholders in software development best practices. </p>

<p>We believe that practices like Test Driven Development, Pairing and Refactoring are the foundation of a high functioning software team. And, we believe that not all Agile practices provide equal value to all teams at all times. So, we approach each engagement as the unique opportunity it is. </p>

<p>As a Strider, you’ll find an opportunity that’s unmatched. You will:</p>

<ul>
<li>Be part of an engineering-driven culture, one that has a 4.9 star Glassdoor review and that’s won Crain’s Best Places to Work 2 years in a row.</li>
<li>Write high-quality code with some of the smartest engineers in town.</li>
<li>Mentor Stride and client engineers.</li>
<li>Immerse yourself in a learning journey that’s second to none. No where else will you find the variety that being a consultant brings, all a subway ride away.</li>
</ul><p>Day In The Life of a Senior Software Engineer</p>

<p>You are empowered to define what work/life balance means to you. As a Strider, you’ll work onsite at your client. We are proud to call some of NYC’s most outstanding tech teams our clients, from startups to enterprise.  </p>

<p>You will be part of a Stride team, on a client engagement. Your work week will involve 70%-80% client work, including coding, and mentoring Agile engineering best practices. The rest of your time will be spent on things like: managing Striders, being the engagement lead on your client, owning company-level initiatives, being a thought leader.</p>

<pre><code>                                                     Here’s how a day might unfold:
</code></pre>

<p>9am: One-on-one meeting with the client’s CTO.  I’m the engagement lead on my client. I meet with the CTO weekly. We go over the plans for the week and give each other feedback. I take notes so I can relay the info to the team. </p>

<p>10am: Daily Standup. Standup lasts 5 minutes and then we’re off to code.</p>

<p>10:10-12:30 Pair Programming. This morning, I’m pairing with another Strider. She’s been coding 3 years, and she’s got strong fundamentals. We’re doing a deep dive into complex backend code. I’m asking questions when I see she gets stuck. She notices a refactoring opportunity and we jump in. </p>

<p>12:30-1:30 Lunch with my team Every Strider gets a company AmEx. We’re encouraged to grab lunch, coffee with our team and/or client to get to know each other. We talk business for 30 minutes and the rest of the time we talk about rock climbing and a new strategy board game Derek bought last week.</p>

<p>1:30-4:00 Pair Programming</p>

<p>4- 5:Sprint Retrospective Retrospectives on my team are amazing. We take turns facilitating, and today we retrospect our last release. </p>

<p>5-6: Stride U DevOps Jam Stride U is ongoing education for Striders by Striders. Seven of us are taking the DevOps Jam course, it’s 1 hour weekly, for 8 weeks.  DevOps is something I’m dipping a toe in and having a safe space to learn real world stuff that I can bring back to my client is great. </p>

<p>6pm: Leave for the Day. It’s been a good day, I throw on my headphones as I head to the subway. </p>

<pre><code>                                                               What you’ll be doing

142,"SENIOR FULL-STACK DEV WITH RUBY/PYTHON/REACT -- 100% REMOTE, FLEXIBLE HOURS",Analytics Fire,"<p><strong>Job Description</strong></p>

<p>Analytics Fire builds custom software for the solar power industry. We’re looking for a senior full-stack developer with a willingness to acquire deep expertise around Ruby, Python, and React.js, in order to help us expand to support additional new high-tech sectors.</p>

<p>Analytics Fire is a small, distributed team working on a range of interesting projects. For example, last year we worked on a scalable IoT platform for utility grade solar power plants, a sales and design tool for residential solar, and a machine-learning powered autonomous cleaning robot. We’re looking for a fun, reliable, and highly collaborative, senior dev to join our team.
For reference, here is a list of technologies and tools we are currently actively using on a day-to-day basis:</p>

<ul>
<li>Front-end: JavaScript / React / Angular</li>
<li>Back-end: Ruby / Python / Node.js</li>
<li>Embedded (IoT): C, Embedded Linux, MQTT</li>
<li>Embedded (robotics): C/C++, ROS</li>
<li>Modern software techniques: RESTful APIs, SOA, PaaS, etc</li>
<li>Agile collaboration and DevOps tools: Github, Trello, Slack, Chef, Ansible, Docker, Vagrant, etc</li>
<li>Occasionally we need to do a small amount of work around: SFDC, iOS, Android, ARKit</li>
</ul><p>This is a remote position. We’re flexible about location and hours, so long as your working hours are in a very heavily US-overlapping time zone (eg: North America, Central America, South America, etc). We’re a really great match for a senior dev in a US-overlapping timezone who wants to work hard on interesting projects, while also having flexibility around time and geography.</p>

<p><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></p>

<p>Ideally, you should have 5+ years commercial full stack development, ideally within a startup environment. You should be comfortable autonomously driving your own high quality / high velocity contributions using a range of technologies.</p>

<p>We work with a variety of technologies, but are currently specifically looking for someone that has or can obtain expert level skills around Python, Ruby, and React.js.</p>

<p><strong>About Analytics Fire</strong></p>

<p>Analytics Fire was founded by a couple of data-nerds -- one a PHd in machine learning and the other a former VP of Engineering for an analytics platform -- who both are also serial entrepreneurs backed by prominent angels and VCs including Y Combinator and 500 Startups.</p>

<p>“Our goal founding, Analytics Fire, was to create the engineering department that we always dreamed of working for. Our dream is to be able to spend our time working on interesting problems, while simultaneously having flexibility around time and geography and being part of a small, tightly-knit team of world-class engineers.”</p>",http://github-jobs.s3.amazonaws.com/17ab996c-1952-11e8-81e3-b60098bb6179.jpg,http://jobs.github.com/positions/95048694-1952-11e8-86d5-38e7f24d7ed9,Github Jobs,"Data & Analytics, Development Tools, Software Engineering, Design Tools, Sales, Analytics & Automation, Industry","226,232,239,244,245,257,270,275,276,278,283,285,299,304,319,328,329,331,334,344,357,379,381,382,383,392,419,420,437,454,455,457,459,472,473,483,489,494,529,552,573,586,591,619,643,673,677,701,729,750,770,814,817,911,942,1027,1111,1128,1171,1190,1317,1332,1410,1424,1429,1460,1463,1466,1488,1496,1516,1532,1646,1795,1809,1870,1947,2021,2050,2273,2473,2506,2508,2518,2527,2591,2610","27,41,45,67,78,90,118",Remote,Full Time

We operate around the clock and around the globe, employing over 500 people in offices in New York, London and Hong Kong.</p>

<p>The markets in which we trade change rapidly, but our intellectual approach changes faster still. Every day, we have new problems to solve and new theories to test. Our entrepreneurial culture is driven by our talented team of traders and programmers. At Jane Street, we don't come to work wanting to leave. We come to work excited to test new theories, have thought-provoking discussions, and maybe sneak in a game of ping-pong or two. Keeping our culture casual and our employees happy is of paramount importance to us.</p>

<p>As Jane Street grows, the quality of the development tools we use matters more and more.  We increasingly work on the OCaml compiler itself: adding useful language features, fine-tuning the type system and improving the performance of the generated code. Alongside this, we also work on the surrounding toolchain, developing new tools for profiling, debugging, documentation and build automation.</p>

<p>We're looking to hire a developer with experience working on compilers to join us. That experience might be from working on a production compiler in industry or from working on research compilers in an academic setting.

151,Leading SAAS Searching for Senior Full-Stack Developer & Project Lead,SixLeaf,"<p><strong>Who We Are:</strong></p>

<p>SixLeaf is the leading marketing platform for third party sellers on Amazon.com as well as a variety of other e-commerce marketplaces. We offer a suite of complete software solutions for brands, both big and small, selling online. These solutions significantly improve marketplace performance and profit for our clients. Simply: we help Brands become ecommerce empires.</p>

<p>Since 2014, our mission has beento help as many brands as possible scale to the point where they are household names. And our goal is to be the very best at it. Since 2014, we’ve established ourselves as the revolutionary innovators in a fast-paced industry. By helping quality brands grow, not only can we assist our clients to achieve their dreams, but we make the market a better place for consumers. Each member of our team shares in the joy and responsibility of making the ecommerce world a better place.</p>

<p><strong>What We Are Looking For:</strong></p>

<p>We are, essentially, looking for a Unicorn, and we understand this. We are searching for a capable, full-stack developer with leadership skills. Our project managers have superior coding capabilities because our projects are complex, and we aren’t looking for a project lead who only understands the lingo.</p>

<p>We need someone who can get into the codebase and get their hands dirty when necessary. The project lead will write the backlog and assign tasks to developers working on the project, but may also help correct complicated issues, and on particularly hairy deadlines, may also assist in coding.</p>

<p>We’re looking for a self-starter and a team player who is able to adapt to a rapidly growing and evolving organization in an industry that moves fast. We’re looking for a leader who can act as a multiplier and makes others around them better through automation, code review, documentation, mentoring when necessary, and who can lead a small team confidently. We’re looking for a true software owner who genuinely cares about the impact our platform makes on the client and their Brand. And we’re looking for the naturally curious developer who doesn’t just accept engineering challenges - they embrace challenges and seek them out.</p>

<p><strong>Why Work With Us?</strong></p>

<p>SixLeaf was originally founded in 2014 as ZonBlast - a tool which completely revolutionized the Amazon marketing space. In the last 4 years, we’ve grown exponentially, have been featured at major industry events, on podcasts, and have proudly served thousands of Brand owners. We’ve had the honor of having a direct hand in taking entrepreneurs from mere idea to 7+ figure Brands.</p>

<p>As a team, we consider working for our early-stage tech startup a lifetyle choice, rather than a job choice. Working for SixLeaf can be challenging at times. We operate in a competitive and fast moving industry, so we need to hit aggressive deadlines and there are many times when everyone on the team puts in a lot more hours than they are used to. You’ll work hard but you’ll face exciting challenges that allow you to put your mark on the world.</p>

<p>As an important part of the SixLeaf team, you’ll be responsible for creating innovative tools that help turn our client’s Brands’ into e-commerce empires. You’ll design beautifully simple yet effective solutions that, once released, will provide measurable and direct impact clients’ businesses.</p>

<p><strong>As a valued SixLeaf team member, you’ll:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Learn Something New</strong>: It is very unlikely you’ve ever worked on a project quite like this. You’ll be exposed to a fascinating and challenging new world where you will be learning about an incredibly exciting industry that is still in its infancy. You will immediately make a difference and impact on SixLeaf, its customers, and this industry.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Make More Money:</strong> To put it bluntly; we are generous. As a startup, we don’t quite have each benchmark that determines bonus structures and pay increases set in stone yet, but we have consistently been extremely giving. We’ve given a bonus each year for the “Christmas” season. We’ve given raises after each 90-day probationary period. We also regularly increase pay based on exemplary performance. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Expand Your Skillset:</strong> You’ll be exposed to developers around the world who each bring a unique set of skills to the table. You’ll also be learning the intricacies of a relatively new industry to the SAAS space, which will require expansion on current knowledge. Overall, you will walk away from this job a more capable and productive individual having learned from the best in the industry.</p></li>
</ul><p>At SixLeaf, and as a fully distributed team, we value respect, transparency, dedication, and innovation. We honor our respective team-members strengths by promoting collaboration.</p>

<p>In addition, we offer:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Generous pay, benefits, and performance-based bonuses</p></li>
<li><p>Generous paid time off policy</p></li>
<li><p>Ability to work remotely in a fully distributed team connected by tools like Slack, Zoom, and more</p></li>
<li><p>Access to a growing library of industry-specific educational material that will help you deliver the best for our clients</p></li>
<li><p>Flexible results-driven schedule</p></li>
<li><p>A team that has cares immeasurably about the results it provides for clients. We take what we do seriously. We know that the results we obtain for clients by way of the software you will help create and improve have direct impacts on entrepreneurs’ businesses, families, and lives. Though we may be distributed, the common drive and connection we all have rivals even </p></li>
</ul><p><strong>What We Need:</strong></p>

<p>Developers are some of the brightest and most amazing people on the planet. However, they can also tend to overcomplicate things. Often, if you ask a developer to turn on a light, he’ll try to build a machine using complex algorithms and a system of wires to engage the light mechanism from their side of the room rather than just walk over to the switch and flip it.</p>

<p>What we need is a project lead that brings balance between genius ideas and common sense solutions. Someone who is nimble, cross-disciplinary, and mindful of client needs. Someone who embraces being a key player in the leadership team. And someone who is results-driven, focused on problem-solving and who can act as a multiplier in any team. If you are an out of the box thinker who loves to invent creative ways to solve problems while also seeing the simplest path, this may be for you.</p>

<p>If you aren’t afraid of hard work and want to be a part of a growing team hell-bent on taking over an entire niche, we may be a fit for each other.</p>

153,Experienced Software Engineers,Loco2,"<p>Loco2's mission is to make booking trains anywhere in Europe as easy and affordable as possible, from epic international adventures to everyday local commutes. Our booking coverage is unrivalled and growing.</p>

<p>We're looking for 2 experienced Ruby engineers to join our existing team of six, where you'll help us maintain and improve our existing infrastructure, integrate new rail operator booking systems and scale effectively for our rapidly expanding user base.</p>

<p>At Loco2 we care deeply about building an inclusive, open and supportive work environment. We behave with respect for people and the planet and are seeking a diverse range of candidates that share these values.</p>

<p><strong>About us</strong></p>

<p>We're a <a href=""https://loco2.com/team"">small, passionate and cosmopolitan team</a>, with a healthy remote-first culture and an office in London. Our success is built on trust, empathy and shared knowledge, with our users at the centre of what we do. <a href=""https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/loco2.com"">We're proud to have an average rating of 9.3 out of 10 on Trustpilot</a> after 22,000 reviews.</p>

<p>We’ve been selling tickets since 2012 (read our <a href=""https://loco2.com/our-story"">full story here</a>), and we’re growing rapidly as the business matures. Our goal is to scale effectively whilst continuing to delight our users.</p>

<p><em>Why join us?</em></p>

<ul>
<li>We have high codings standards, and follow best practices such as continuous testing and delivery</li>
<li>We strive to learn and improve together in a supportive environment as the wider tech ecosystem evolves</li>
<li>Our team enjoys a healthy work-life balance and don’t think caffeine-fuelled all-nighters are a good way to grow a company that’s built to last</li>
<li>We offer flexible hours and a well-designed remote working culture built on trust. Work around your schedule and when you’re most productive</li>
<li>Our days are not full of meetings and needless distractions, allowing others to achieve flow is a big part of supporting each other</li>
<li>Everyone is encouraged to ask questions, think creatively and suggest new working practices. We have a small team so your voice will be heard</li>
<li>You will be provided with a laptop and are empowered to make changes that improve your working environment</li>
</ul><p><strong>Technical challenges</strong></p>

<p>Our software stack consists of a pure-Ruby backend library which we use to communicate with train booking APIs, a modern Rails application, a PostgreSQL database, and two native mobile applications (iOS and Android).</p>

<p>We’re integrated with multiple rail operator booking systems (with our current team we usually complete at least 1-2 major integrations each year), and we’re increasingly consuming other types of data too (e.g. timetable data for routing, real-time arrivals/departures etc).</p>

<p>We need to diligently manage technical complexity, as each external system works in a slightly different way, with its own features and quirks. SOAP is (unfortunately) used by many operator APIs, which is why we released our open source library, <a href=""https://github.com/loco2/lolsoap"">LolSoap</a>.</p>

<p>Some of the most difficult challenges we face relate to routing and making sense of lots of data. Which routes are best to get from A to B? Which booking systems should be queried? How might we cache data without affecting accuracy of results?</p>

<p>We’ve recently released mobile applications for iOS and Android. Further developing our mobile strategy is a key goal for the business.</p>

<p>Because Loco2 is the merchant of record for all transactions we are also responsible for fraud prevention, and handling currency and other finance-related issues.</p>

<p>We frequently release new features that drive rapid organic growth, and so it’s vital that we anticipate and address scaling challenges before they occur.</p>

<p><strong>About you</strong></p>

<p>An ideal candidate:</p>

<ul>
<li>Has 4+ years of professional programming experience</li>
<li>Has deep knowledge and experience of Ruby</li>
<li>Is fluent in English and confident communicating and sharing complex information and learnings with both technical and non-technical team members</li>
<li>Has a good working knowledge of modern devops technologies such as Docker</li>
<li>Is comfortable designing object oriented software from scratch, not just implementing CRUD Rails apps; a pragmatist who can see the trade-offs involved in the different approaches to solving a problem</li>
<li>Strives to discover and understand the root cause of problems, suggesting new and improved solutions, rather than treating the symptoms</li>
<li>Actively considers future maintainability when deciding how to implement something</li>
<li>Has a keen appetite for self-improvement and growth, but doesn't hesitate to ask for help when needed</li>
<li>Enjoys getting their teeth stuck into complicated problems, as well as being willing to pitch in on some of the more routine tasks which inevitably arise</li>
<li>Is willing to participate in an on-call rota to cover technical emergencies out of hours</li>
<li>Can work hours that have some overlap with London daytime</li>
<li>Is motivated by Loco2's mission</li>

156,Senior Software Engineer -- Javascript,Very LLC,"<p>Interviewing for a new company is a serious time commitment for all parties involved. Please take the time to read this and thoughtfully consider if we would be a good fit for one another. This is a full-time position. You must be located in the continental U.S. No contractors or agencies. Seriously. </p>

<p><strong>Why We Started Very</strong></p>

<p>Not to oversimplify things, but our mission is to become the best IoT, blockchain, and machine learning product development shop in the world. We do this by hiring the best and investing heavily in them, both personally and professionally.</p>

<p><strong>We Fully Embrace Working Remotely</strong></p>

<p>About 30% of our team works out of our HQ in Chattanooga, TN, and the other 70% work remotely from various locations across the United States. We consider ourselves best-practitioners of the remote-first movement and believe a great team shouldn’t be restricted by geography.</p>

<p><strong>What You’ll Be Working On</strong></p>

<p>Very is first and foremost a software consultancy, we tackle hard problems for clients who need a targeted, senior team to come in and provide specific solutions. We are focusing heavily on building out products that have applications in one of the three following areas: 1) data science &amp; machine learning, 2) Internet of Things, and 3) blockchain. We’ve found that in each of these areas, the use of the underlying technology will drive the development of the core services , but that 75% of the work often still lives in the realm of modern web development.</p>

<p>At Very, there is a never ending supply of variety to the types of projects we work on. In the last year we’ve built solutions that touch e-commerce, trust management (finance), beer distribution, point of sale systems, ICO’s, identifying fake news, and much more.</p>

<p>You’ll spend 80% of your week (Monday through Thursday) designing and building a product or platform for one of our clients. The other 20% of your week (Friday) will be spent contributing to our open source projects, internal products, learning, teaching, and participating in internal operations of all flavors. </p>

<p>Project teams are small and usually made up of one or two pairs of engineers, a UX engineer, a product manager, and the client who serves as the product owner. We spend most of our time building new products, with the goal of helping our clients take it to market. We are often further engaged by our clients to continue iterating on the product once it is live. The high cost of context switching is real, so we do our best to keep teams together throughout the duration of their projects (typically 3-6 months), but have found it valuable to rotate pairing partners when it makes reasonable sense. </p>

<p>We are always exploring new tools, languages, and technologies. We feel strongly that it’s a good idea to use the best tool for the job and not see everything as a nail. We also try our best to standardize our technology and tooling across project teams so it’s easier to rotate and practice collective code ownership. We are currently building products and platforms using the following tools / platforms:</p>

<ul>
<li>React &amp; React Native</li>
<li>Swift &amp; Objective C</li>
<li>Elixir,  Phoenix, and Nerves</li>
<li>Arduino (embedded C/C++)</li>
<li>Ethereum / Solidity</li>
<li>Ruby on Rails</li>
<li>Python</li>
<li>Pandas</li>
<li>Serverless</li>
<li>AWS (and a dash of Heroku where it makes sense)</li>
</ul><p>Given that we work on quite a bit of greenfield projects, there is often room to experiment with new patterns and tools (within reason). We don’t expect applicants to know our entire toolchain, but rather to be capable, flexible, and self-directed.</p>

<p><strong>This Role:  Senior Software Engineer // Javascript</strong></p>

<p>Over the past few years, we’ve seen client-side engineering emerge as its own discipline, and we are looking for individuals who thrive in the front end and want to further their practice. Ideal candidates not only have a solid engineering background, but a passion for client-side development as well. 
We value well-tested, reusable code and expect our engineers to be as good of practitioners as they are leaders and teachers. </p>

<p><strong>How We Operate</strong></p>

<p>We are believers in transparency and openness. In terms of organizational structure and governance, we are a holacracy. It’s worked pretty well for the us the last few years. When it comes to development processes, we do our best to adhere as closely to Extreme Programming as possible. We believe in hiring capable, responsible professionals. We don’t micromanage and trust everyone to work hard, experiment, learn from their mistakes, and contribute to each other and the company in a sustainable manner. We have no venture funding or external investors, which affords us the ability to be nimble and run our company in the best interest of our team as a whole.   </p>

<p><strong>How You’ll Be Compensated</strong></p>

<p>We believe in a transparent, fair compensation structure and have developed our own open salary formula. Depending on your skill and experience, you can expect to make somewhere between $80,000 and $135,000 upon joining the company. We have many health plans available through UHC—prices and plans vary based on your region—as well as vision and dental. We currently contribute a large portion to each plan, again, amounts vary based on region.  As an added benefit, Very provides 1X Earnings Basic Life &amp; AD&amp;D. We have a 401k program that we’ll provide a 2% match on after a few months working with us. Lastly, 35% of the company’s ownership is reserved for a team member options pool.</p>",http://github-jobs.s3.amazonaws.com/a4da71c6-18b4-11e8-8455-455ff055b230.png,http://jobs.github.com/positions/a946a234-18b4-11e8-8fe6-c05d1d2bc0f8,Github Jobs,"Core Finance, Web Development, Programming Languages, Personal Finance, Data & Analytics, Operating Systems, Finance, Project Management, Software Testing, Development Tools, Web Design, Software Engineering, Management, Motivation, Productivity, Design Tools, Production, Sales, Test Taking Skills, Teaching Tools, Operations, E-Commerce, Fitness, Other Programming, Product Marketing","144,145,146,147,148,149,150,151,152,153","14,22,24,26,27,30,32,37,40,41,44,45,56,60,63,67,76,78,89,98,100,103,106,108,122","Chattanooga, TN",Full Time

167,Humbly Confident Senior Mobile Developer,YNAB (You Need A Budget),"<p>At YNAB, we build the world’s best budgeting software. But we’re even prouder of teaching people how to align their money and their priorities, and in turn changing their lives.</p>

<p>We have big plans for our iOS and Android apps. In the Summer of 2017 we brought most of the functionality of the web app to our mobile apps, and now we’re looking to take them even further.</p>

<p>If you’re the one we’re looking for, you have extensive experience with iOS or Android and are excited to help us with <em>both</em> platforms. Heck, you’re also excited about getting to work with the TypeScript and SQL we use in our shared library. This isn’t your first rodeo. You’ve got 5 or more years of experience, and can point to multiple applications you have helped ship.</p>

<p>That’s a super-brief intro of what you’ll be working on. But first, you need to know if you’ll even like working with us. We think you will.</p>

<p><strong>A Bit About Us</strong></p>

<p>We build the best budgeting software around, YNAB or “You Need a Budget” if you have a lot of extra time on your hands. For more than a decade, people have been buying YNAB and then telling their friends what a difference it has made in their lives. (Google us, and you’ll see what we mean.) We love building something that has a huge positive impact on people’s lives.</p>

<p>We’re profitable, bootstrapped, and growing. YNAB started in 2004 and we haven’t taken any outside funding—we’re in it for the long haul.</p>

<p>We have one overarching requirement when it comes to joining our team: our Cultural Manifesto has to really click with you. If you’re nodding emphatically while reading it, you’ll probably fit right in!</p>

<p>First, let’s talk about life at YNAB and then we’ll go into detail about what we’re looking for.</p>

<p><strong>Who you’d be working with:</strong></p>

<p>Our developer team is 12 people strong, but we all work pretty closely. For that matter, we also work in cross-functional teams frequently so you'll get to work with people in all different roles in the company. As a small sampling though, here are a few that you'll definitely rub digital shoulders with:</p>

<p>Taylor, our CTO, was our digital nomad for a couple of years while he travelled...pretty much everywhere. He's now slowing down a bit and lives in Austin Texas, where he's learning to flex his handyman muscles while renovating their home. He's exceptionally good at escape room games and his super skill is explaining the rules of a board game in the most concise and understandable way you've ever heard. He also wins a lot of those board games.</p>

<p>Sebastian, our mobile lead developer, works mostly on the iOS side of things here at YNAB. When he's not busy at YNAB he's either out walking the dogs, pretending to be a firefighter, feeding the cats or playing with his new server rack in the barn. He lives in rural Switzerland which might explain the barn - and by rural we mean it'd take you an hour to get to Zurich.</p>

<p>Graham, our Android tech lead, is on a mission to convert everything to RxJava and Kotlin, and is constantly dabbling with various architecture patterns and solutions for cross-platform code-sharing. He lives in Scotland, where he hopes to one day be a decent enough guitarist to play a tune and actually have someone recognize it.</p>

<p>He's an aviation geek who obsessively binge-watches entire seasons of Air Crash Investigations, just in case it might come in useful someday.</p>

<p><strong>How You’ll Work at YNAB</strong></p>

<p>We work really hard to make working at YNAB an amazing experience. We have a team full of truly exceptional people—the kind you’ll be excited to work with. Here’s how we operate:</p>

<p><strong>Live Where You Want.</strong>
We’re a distributed team, so you can live and work wherever you want. Proximity doesn’t influence productivity. Just make sure you have a reliable internet connection.</p>

<p><strong>No Crazy Hours.</strong>
We rarely work more than 40 hours per week. There have been a few occasions where things got a little crazy and people had to log some extra hours. But then they took some extra time off, so it all balances out. We work hard and smart but we’re in this for the long haul, no need to go crazy on the hours.</p>

<p><strong>Take Vacation (Seriously).</strong>
We want you to take vacation. In fact, we have a minimum vacation policy of three weeks per year (plus two extra weeks for Christmas break). It’s important to get out and do something. We’ll look forward to seeing pictures of your vacation in our internal chat room, creatively named #office_wall.</p>

<p><strong>The YNAB Retreat.</strong>
We get the teams together once a year to catch up on spreadsheets and powerpoints in a Best Western conference room. Just kidding. So far, we’ve done Costa Rica, a gigantic cabin in the mountains, and a beach house in the Outer Banks. This year is a ranch in Montana. We do really fun things, but the highlight is always just hanging out together and having a blast.</p>

<p><strong>Up Your Game.</strong>
We’re serious about helping you improve your craft. We budget for it (hey-o!).. Think conferences, Lynda subscriptions, books, dedicated time away from work to learn something new... it’s really up to you and your manager. But we love to see our people growing.  </p>

<p><strong>If You’re International...</strong>
You’ll be set up as a contractor. Employee or contractor, it’s all the same to us. You’re part of the team. As for time zones, we’re flexible as long as a decent chunk of your time overlaps with North American time zones.</p>

<p><strong>If You’re Stateside…</strong>
You’ll be a W2 employee with fantastic health, dental, and vision insurance, where we cover 100% of the premium for you and your family. (No need to check your vision, you read that right, 100%. Although if you did need to check your vision, no big deal, we’ve got you covered!)</p>

<p>We also have Traditional and Roth 401k options. YNAB contributes three percent whether you choose to throw any money in there or not. It vests immediately. (Are you a personal finance junkie like Jesse? He set up YNAB’s 401k to have the lowest fee structure possible, where all plan costs are paid by YNAB, not your retirement nest egg. The investment funds available are fantastic, passively-managed, ultra low-cost index funds. You’re not a PF junkie? Then trust us, it’s great.)</p>

<p><strong>Other Tidbits</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Once you start, we DEMAND (in a friendly, ALL CAPS IS YELLING way) that you fill out your “Bucket List” spreadsheet with 50 items. (That’s harder than it sounds!)</li>
<li>The bucket list helps in deciding what we should give you for your birthday and Christmas: No gift cards here. We tried that. Super boring.</li>
<li>We have a bonus plan based on profitability. You’ll be in on that from day one. YNAB wins, you win. That kind of thing.</li>
<li>We’re all adults. There’s no need to punch a clock, or ask for permission to take off early one afternoon to go see the doctor (health insurance premium 100% covered!). We look at what you’re accomplishing, not how long you sit (have you tried standing?) in front of a computer.</li>
<li>We want you firing on all cylinders so we’ll set you up with a shiny new computer and replace it every three years.</li>
<li>Did I mention we make a huge, positive difference in people’s lives? We have a Slack channel where we share success stories from our customers daily. It’s amazing. Don’t underestimate this one!</li>
</ul><p>If this sounds like your ideal environment, read on because now I want to talk about you. You will play a big part in helping YNAB delight users and give them control of their money.  You will change lives. </p>

<p><strong>Now, back to you, our new Mobile Developer…</strong></p>

<p>You're a mobile developer with over 5 years of experience. At least two of those have been spent working with either iOS or Android, or both. (If you have experience with only one, you’re excited to work with the other. We love both platforms for different reasons, and want you to as well.)  You know how to write easy-to-maintain software while still keeping an eye on the roadmap.</p>

<p>You'll help us implement new features and maintain existing apps on both iOS and Android. We have native implementations for each platform but use a shared library based on TypeScript for things that, well, need to be shared across platforms. For performance and maintainability reasons there is plenty of SQL code as well. You don't have to be an expert on TypeScript or SQL, but being curious about how things work on that layer will definitely help. Our baselines are Lollipop on Android and iOS 9 on iOS. You'll get to work with things like Kotlin and RxJava on Android. On iOS you'll work with Objective-C and Swift on a universal app and an Apple watch app.</p>

<p><strong>You’re the one we’re looking for if you:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Are an excellent developer and can adapt to new languages quickly.</li>
<li>Write code that is easy for other programmers to understand and use.</li>
<li>Have excellent debugging skills. You know how to find problems, and how to architect apps so that problems are discoverable in the first place.</li>
<li>Are self-motivated and thrive with directions like:
""This part of the program is too slow, and these are the places that might be good to start looking.""<br>
""This component needs to be re-architected to allow for X. How do you think we should do it?""
“Our code needs to call into a Javascript library, but that Javascript library is crashing because it can’t find the setTimeout method. Can you investigate?”</li>
<li>Are excited to work across multiple platforms with different technologies.</li>
<li>Have experience with:
Kotlin / Java
Or
Swift / Objective-C</li>
<li>Have shipped or helped ship at least one significant app for either iOS or Android.</li>
<li>Are a senior developer who can point to strong experience where you’ve exemplified the bullet points above.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Bonus Point:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>You already use and love YNAB.</li>
</ul><p>Salary will be between $90k and $125k, depending on experience.</p>

<p>And, since our job descriptions are already so long, what’s another sentence or two…</p>

<p>YNAB is an equal opportunity employer. We believe diversity of backgrounds, beliefs, and experiences to be critical to our success and are passionate about creating a welcoming, supportive, and collaborative environment for all employees.

173,Manufacturing Software Engineer,Mayfield Robotics,"<p>About the Company:</p>

<p>At Mayfield Robotics, we make home robots that are joyful, useful, and inspiring. We move fast, we like and respect each other, and we have some very big ambitions. And we’re still growing.</p>

<p>We operate with all the best aspects of being a startup: independence, speed, transparency, teamwork, and a well-stocked kitchen. We also have the focus and discipline of a company that knows exactly where it’s going, without the distraction of fundraising (we’re wholly owned by a much larger company that loves what we’re doing, thinks long term, and mostly leaves us alone). We were founded in February of 2015, and we’re based in sunny Redwood City, California - the epicenter of both Silicon Valley and the future of robotics.</p>

<p>About the Role:</p>

<p>Do you like robots? As you know, they still can’t manufacture themselves. But if you do well enough at this, you could put yourself out of a job by making that a reality!</p>

<p>Mayfield’s Manufacturing team is increasing the capacity of our robot factory. We need someone to guide the software facet of building robots to ensure smooth deliveries to our eager customers. The goal is to ensure a smooth production line. This includes making sure the test stations on the line function properly, get updated securely and scale effectively to meet our throughput targets. You will ensure the correct software is put on each robot before it ships to a customer. Additionally, you will be responsible for collecting all the data from all the stations, getting the data into the correct systems and making sure the data is correct and complete so that the complete lifecycle of the robot can be tracked. There is no glory here: If you excel at your job, things will just work.</p>

<p>Come help us meet our excited customers demand for cute, adorable home robots and be on the forefront of mass produced robots.</p>

<p>Responsibilities:</p>

<pre><code>Bridge the gap between Mayfield’s Manufacturing and Software teams
Help Manufacturing Engineers turn requirements into high-quality software
Document and create a maintainable way to keep manufacturing line up to date and reproducible
Work with Test Engineers to develop reliable subassembly and end-of-line tests
Work with IT Specialists to deploy and maintain our networking infrastructure at the contract manufacturer’s site
Bake security into the manufacturing and software provisioning processes
Continuously improve, automate, and parallelize assembly line steps in order to reduce cycle time and variability while increasing quality and throughput
25-50% travel to China in order to support manufacturing and deploy software
</code></pre>

<p>Required Qualifications:</p>

<pre><code>4+ years of professional software engineering experience with Python, C++, and/or Javascript
Embedded Linux experience (both x86 and ARM architectures)
Basic Linux networking and security experience
Experience developing firmware for microcontrollers (e.g. AVR)
Familiarity with off-the-shelf computer vision tools and libraries (e.g. OpenCV)
The candidate must have a multi-entry Chinese visa, meet the requirements for obtaining one, or not require a visa in order to travel to China
</code></pre>

<p>Nice to Have:</p>

<pre><code>Has shipped a robotics, IoT, or high-volume consumer-electronics product
Has experience supporting manufacturing operations or has worked in a factory-facing role
Understanding of data acquisition and signal processing (for example FFT; Fast Fourier Transform)

205,Software Engineer,Azavea,"<p>Overview</p>

<p>Azavea is a civic technology firm based in Philadelphia that uses geospatial data to build software and data analytics for the web.  As a B Corporation, our mission is to use advanced geospatial technology for civic, social, and environmental impact. Most of our work deals with local governments, non-profit organizations, and academic or federal research projects.  We build custom web applications, perform geospatial analysis, and contribute to open source projects.  Our engineers work across the technology stack, from modern browser-based front-ends to robust service-based backends residing on scalable infrastructure.</p>

<p>We are looking for a Software Engineer who is passionate about building and operating applications that will have a positive impact. Ideal candidates are interested in public service, but not necessarily in working for a government or a non-profit organization.</p>

<p>We’re excited about what we do, we’re growing, and we hope you will join us.</p>

<p>Skills &amp; Requirements</p>

<p>Azavea has five software teams, all of which develop web software for processing and visualizing geospatial data.  The teams differ in terms of the specific projects they develop and whether they are primarily product or service focussed. The GeoTrellis team develops an open source software framework that enables low latency, distributed processing of geospatial data; the majority of our work is currently funded by the U.S. Federal government. The project is based on Scala and Apache Spark. It is used in many types of web applications, including processing satellite imagery, climate change, precision agriculture, public transit travel-sheds, and watershed modeling. GeoTrellis is a member of the Eclipse Foundation’s LocationTech working group. A significant focus of the past year has been developing Python Bindings in an effort to expand the pool of developers that can benefit from GeoTrellis. GeoTrellis is growing, and we need your help to expand the framework and make it more useful to other developers.</p>

<p>What You’ll Do
Build scalable back-end software where performance is critical.
Implement new features, algorithms, data processing operations, benchmarks and tests for a large Scala-based software framework.
Engage in multidisciplinary work that applies an agile process (scrum board, daily stand-ups and two-week iterations) to design, architecture, development, testing and deployment.
Support the development of an open source community around the GeoTrellis project.
Contribute to both a growing company and to the open source communities that support our work.</p>

<p>You should
Demonstrate fluency with at least one functional programming language such as Scala, Clojure or Haskell.
Be able to adapt and lean in order to keep innovating on a cutting edge open source project.
Have experience with Amazon Web Service  or another cloud-based architecture.
Interested in working with a small, collaborative team on meaningful projects.
Get excited about contributing to a large, complex open source project.</p>

<p>You get extra points for
Experience with Spark, Akka, or other Scala-based distributed processing frameworks.
Having worked with distributed data processing frameworks, like Hadoop, Amazon MR, etc.
Demonstrating your open source or other community service contributions.
Strong background in algorithm development where performance is critical.</p>

<p>You’ll notice that we don’t cite N years of experience or a Computer Science as requirements.  Formal credentials like these are valuable, but we are primarily looking for people who have gained real-world experience successfully building sophisticated web applications.  </p>

<p>Office and Benefits</p>

<p>Our Philadelphia headquarters is located in a brightly lit office on the 5th floor of a converted factory building in the Callowhill neighborhood, a short walk from Center City, the Reading Terminal Market, and SEPTA subway and regional rail stations.

You get your own desk with a high-end Linux workstation or Apple laptop and extra monitors.

After the first six months, our staff can also spend up to 10% of their time on an open source, professional development, or R&amp;D project.  Recent 10% time projects include experiments with machine learning, Python 3, Reactive Native, and various forms of serverless processing with Amazon Lambda.</p>

<p>We offer a salary commensurate with skills and experience and a benefits package that includes:
Fully subsidized health care, dental, prescription plan, including for spouse/partner and children
Fully subsidized life and long term disability insurance, plus voluntary short term disability insurance
Medical reimbursement plan to cover what the health insurance does not

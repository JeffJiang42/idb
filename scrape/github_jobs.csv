We operate around the clock and around the globe, employing over 500 people in offices in New York, London and Hong Kong.</p>

<p>The markets in which we trade change rapidly, but our intellectual approach changes faster still. Every day, we have new problems to solve and new theories to test. Our entrepreneurial culture is driven by our talented team of traders and programmers. At Jane Street, we don't come to work wanting to leave.

31,Production Engineer,New Classrooms,"<p>About the Role</p>

<p>Because we’re in the middle of a complete replatforming, we’re supporting multiple legacy environments while a separate department (Software Engineering) builds the new one. Each time Software Engineering completes a component of the new platform, Production Engineering partners with them to ensure launch readiness and do the actual launch, and then takes over the maintenance and enhancement of that component. This role can be remote.</p>

<p>About You</p>

<p>You seek out worthwhile challenges, thrive in complexity, and find satisfaction in making complicated things simpler. Your technical depth is matched by your depth of character; nothing is ever “someone else’s problem” to you. Your teammates can always count on you in a pinch; you exhibit grace under pressure. You’re always learning and always improving. You let nothing stand in your way because success is the only option when serving the greater good.</p>

<p>About the Technology</p>

<p>New Environment</p>

<p>Angular 4+, and therefore TypeScript</p>

<p>Modern RESTful services built with .NET Core 2+, C#, and OAuth 2 / OpenID, all running on a PaaS and not tied to any particular OS</p>

<p>MEAN (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js) running on a PaaS</p>

<p>Python (with Django and Celery), RabbitMQ, and PostgreSQL, all running on Linux VMs</p>

<p>Both environments</p>

<p>Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services</p>

<p>Serverless: Azure Functions and AWS Lambda</p>

<p>PaaS: Azure Web Apps and AWS Elastic Beanstalk</p>

<p>IaaS: Azure Virtual Machines, AWS EC2 instances, and various other services</p>

<p>Atlassian: JIRA, Confluence, Bitbucket, and Bamboo</p>

<p>Requirements</p>

<p>C# expertise. We’re also open to candidates who are strong in another language and interested in switching.</p>

<p>Solid understanding of REST, HTTP, and Internet/web/cloud fundamentals.</p>

<p>Familiarity with relational databases and SQL.</p>

<p>Familiarity with JavaScript (especially TypeScript and Angular), HTML, and CSS.</p>

<p>Extraordinary attention to detail.</p>

<p>Excellent written, verbal, and visual communication skills.</p>

<p>Expertise in anything listed under “Legacy Environments” above is a plus.</p>

<p>On-call duty, but don’t worry, we get it. The leadership of New Classrooms includes a recovering former Google SRE. We respect your time.</p>

<p>Interest in education technology or education reform, required</p>

55,Experienced Mobile Engineer,Loco2,"<p>Loco2's mission is to make booking trains anywhere in Europe as easy and affordable as possible, from epic international adventures to everyday local commutes. Our booking coverage is unrivalled and growing.</p>

<p>We're looking for an experienced mobile engineer to join our growing engineering team. You will help us deliver a world-class mobile experience through our hybrid iOS app, combining fully native views with our Single Page Application (see below).</p>

<p>At Loco2 we care deeply about building an inclusive, open and supportive work environment. We behave with respect for people and the planet and are seeking a diverse range of candidates that share these values.</p>

<p><strong>About us</strong></p>

<p>We're a <a href=""https://loco2.com/team"">small, passionate and cosmopolitan team</a>, with a healthy remote-first culture and an office in London. Our success is built on trust, empathy and shared knowledge, with our users at the centre of what we do. <a href=""https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/loco2.com"">We're proud to have an average rating of 9.3 out of 10 on Trustpilot</a> after 22,000 reviews.</p>

<p>We’ve been selling tickets since 2012 (read our <a href=""https://loco2.com/our-story"">full story here</a>), and we’re growing rapidly as the business matures. Our goal is to scale effectively whilst continuing to delight our users.</p>

<p><strong>Tech stack and role description</strong></p>

<p>Our current mobile applications are <a href=""https://m.signalvnoise.com/hybrid-development-is-how-we-give-our-teams-of-three-superpowers-2021a84437d"">hybrid</a>, mixing fully native views with numerous embedded web-views, presenting parts of our mobile website.</p>

<p>We’re sticking with the hybrid approach (i.e. we don’t intend to ever have fully native apps) but are now transitioning our traditional multi-page web application to a React-powered single-page application. We’re <a href=""https://loco2.com/en/careers/web-developer"">hiring separately for experienced front-end developers</a> to accelerate this transition.</p>

<p>Once we’ve transitioned to the SPA, lots of functionality/UX will be identical across our mobile website and applications, but there remain areas where we’ll need to use native functionality. One of Loco2’s main goals is to be useful to customers when they are travelling, and building an exceptional mobile UX that feels truly native is one of our biggest goals for 2018.</p>

<p>Whilst we don’t expect you to be a master of all of the following technologies, our current software stack consists of:</p>

<ul>
<li>A hybrid iOS app written in Swift</li>
<li>A hybrid Android app written in Kotlin</li>
<li>A traditional multi-page web application written in Ruby on Rails, using CoffeeScript and SCSS</li>
<li>A Ruby library for communicating with train booking APIs</li>
<li>AWS hosted Docker infrastructure, with continuous delivery</li>
</ul><p><strong>About you</strong></p>

<p>An ideal candidate:</p>

<ul>
<li>Has 3+ years of professional mobile application development experience</li>
<li>Solid experience with native iOS development</li>
<li>Takes pride in their craft and adheres to industry best practices such as testing, code linting, peer review and clean modular maintainable code</li>
<li>Has a keen appetite for self-improvement and growth, but doesn't hesitate to ask for help when needed</li>
<li>Strives to discover and understand the root cause of problems, suggesting new and improved solutions, rather than treating the symptoms</li>
<li>Is fluent in English and confident communicating and sharing complex information and learnings with both technical and non-technical team members</li>
<li>Can work hours that have some overlap with London daytime</li>
<li>Is motivated by Loco2's mission</li>

<p>As a recognized leader in disciplined agile and lean software development practices, Pivotal combines the Silicon Valley state of mind, modern approach, and infrastructure with organizations’ core expertise and values. Our cloud-native platform and suite of data tools drive software innovation for many of the world’s most admired brands, helping enterprises move at start-up speeds and with greater business agility. We optimize for change and teach next-generation developers to create and build new solutions, and are committed to open source and open standards.</p>

<p>Our methodology is about evolving, in both development and innovation, and our culture is empowering. Our 2,000+ employees across offices worldwide subscribe to an ethos of kindness. We make a point to bring empathy to each and every project, and are guided by a purposeful mission—to transform how the world builds software.</p>

<p><strong>You</strong></p>

<p>You have a passion for developing large distributed systems to manage data. You understand that software that manages data at scale is a little different from other kinds of systems. Solutions that work fine on single nodes with gigabytes of data can fall over when scaled to petabytes of data and thousands of nodes. You relish discovering solutions that perform at scale while preserving the sanctity of customer data. You are curious, love to learn, and love to share your latest discoveries. Above all, you love shipping software as a member of a collaborative team.</p>

<p><strong>Us</strong></p>

<p>Pivotal Greenplum tackles the technical challenges that come with massively parallel distributed systems operating on petabytes of data across thousands of nodes. We delve into areas like query optimization, high-performance in-memory transaction and query processing, parallel and distributed execution of advanced data processing algorithms, resource management, and storage. On this team, you'll be working on hard, worthwhile problems with a collaborative team, accelerating your growth as an engineer.</p>

<p><strong>Your Day</strong></p>

<p>To make sure you start your day energized, we provide a catered breakfast every weekday morning, and unlimited snacks/drinks are available all day. After breakfast, the office has a daily standup as part of our Agile methodology. You will then spend much of your day pair programming in a test-driven-development method. The work culture is highly collaborative. You will have an hour lunch each day, and you'll find that we do a great job of keeping a sustainable workweek, where people leave promptly at the end of the day; we don't work long hours. Our collaborative, open-plan office space is filled with talented, like-minded engineers who enjoy taking advantage of our weekly Tech Talks, yoga classes, playing ping pong, board games and hanging out with their co-workers.</p>

72,Sr. Software Engineer -- Full Stack,Very LLC,"<p>Interviewing for a new company is a serious time commitment for all parties involved. Please take the time to read this and thoughtfully consider if we would be a good fit for one another. This is a full-time position. You must be located in the continental U.S. No contractors or agencies. Seriously. </p>

<p><strong>Why We Started Very</strong></p>

<p>Not to oversimplify things, but our mission is to become the best IoT, blockchain, and machine learning product development shop in the world. We do this by hiring the best and investing heavily in them, both personally and professionally.</p>

<p><strong>We Fully Embrace Working Remotely</strong></p>

<p>About 30% of our team works out of our HQ in Chattanooga, TN, and the other 70% work remotely from various locations across the United States. We consider ourselves best-practitioners of the remote-first movement and believe a great team shouldn’t be restricted by geography.</p>

<p><strong>What You’ll Be Working On</strong></p>

<p>Very is first and foremost a software consultancy, we tackle hard problems for clients who need a targeted, senior team to come in and provide specific solutions. We are focusing heavily on building out products that have applications in one of the three following areas: 1) data science &amp; machine learning, 2) Internet of Things, and 3) blockchain. We’ve found that in each of these areas, the use of the underlying technology will drive the development of the core services , but that 75% of the work often still lives in the realm of modern web development.</p>

<p>At Very, there is a never ending supply of variety to the types of projects we work on. In the last year we’ve built solutions that touch e-commerce, trust management (finance), beer distribution, point of sale systems, ICO’s, identifying fake news, and much more.</p>

<p>You’ll spend 80% of your week (Monday through Thursday) designing and building a product or platform for one of our clients. The other 20% of your week (Friday) will be spent contributing to our open source projects, internal products, learning, teaching, and participating in internal operations of all flavors. </p>

<p>Project teams are small and usually made up of one or two pairs of engineers, a UX engineer, a product manager, and the client who serves as the product owner. We spend most of our time building new products, with the goal of helping our clients take it to market. We are often further engaged by our clients to continue iterating on the product once it is live. The high cost of context switching is real, so we do our best to keep teams together throughout the duration of their projects (typically 3-6 months), but have found it valuable to rotate pairing partners when it makes reasonable sense. </p>

<p>We are always exploring new tools, languages, and technologies. We feel strongly that it’s a good idea to use the best tool for the job and not see everything as a nail. We also try our best to standardize our technology and tooling across project teams so it’s easier to rotate and practice collective code ownership. We are currently building products and platforms using the following tools / platforms:</p>

<ul>
<li>React &amp; React Native</li>
<li>Swift &amp; Objective C</li>
<li>Elixir,  Phoenix, and Nerves</li>
<li>Arduino (embedded C/C++)</li>
<li>Ethereum / Solidity</li>
<li>Ruby on Rails</li>
<li>Python</li>
<li>Pandas</li>
<li>Serverless</li>
<li>AWS (and a dash of Heroku where it makes sense)</li>
</ul><p>Given that we work on quite a bit of greenfield projects, there is often room to experiment with new patterns and tools (within reason). We don’t expect applicants to know our entire toolchain, but rather to be capable, flexible, and self-directed.</p>

<p><strong>This Role: Senior Full-Stack Software Engineer</strong></p>

<p>As a full-stack engineer at Very, you will work on a wide variety of projects and stacks. This job is a great fit for pragmatic polyglot programmers with a functional bend. Over the last few years, we’ve shipped countless Ruby on Rails projects and are at the tail end of moving to Elixir for the bulk of our services. Additionally, we have a strong Python contingent who are utilizing the serverless framework for the development of highly targeted microservices / systems as well as for data science and machine learning projects.</p>

<p>We value well-tested, reusable code and expect our engineers to be as good of practitioners as they are leaders and teachers. </p>

<p><strong>How We Operate</strong></p>

<p>We are believers in transparency and openness. In terms of organizational structure and governance, we are a holacracy. It’s worked pretty well for the us the last few years. When it comes to development processes, we do our best to adhere as closely to Extreme Programming as possible. We believe in hiring capable, responsible professionals. We don’t micromanage and trust everyone to work hard, experiment, learn from their mistakes, and contribute to each other and the company in a sustainable manner. We have no venture funding or external investors, which affords us the ability to be nimble and run our company in the best interest of our team as a whole.   </p>

<p><strong>How You’ll Be Compensated</strong></p>

<p>We believe in a transparent, fair compensation structure and have developed our own open salary formula. Depending on your skill and experience, you can expect to make somewhere between $80,000 and $135,000 upon joining the company. We have many health plans available through UHC—prices and plans vary based on your region—as well as vision and dental. We currently contribute a large portion to each plan, again, amounts vary based on region.  As an added benefit, Very provides 1X Earnings Basic Life &amp; AD&amp;D. We have a 401k program that we’ll provide a 2% match on after a few months working with us. Lastly, 35% of the company’s ownership is reserved for a team member options pool.</p>",http://github-jobs.s3.amazonaws.com/39840ce2-18b5-11e8-90d0-e77517e96327.png,http://jobs.github.com/positions/5fb0f844-18b5-11e8-9060-a6cd38ce583f,Github Jobs,"Core Finance, Web Development, Programming Languages, Personal Finance, Data & Analytics, Operating Systems, Finance, Project Management, Software Testing, Development Tools, Web Design, Software Engineering, Management, Motivation, Productivity, Design Tools, Production, Sales, Test Taking Skills, Teaching Tools, Operations, E-Commerce, Fitness, Other Programming, Product Marketing"

81,Global Head of Data,Lazada Services SEA,"<p>The role
Summary:
Take ownership, train and grow the data engineering and statistical learning (""data science"") team of the largest Logistics company in South East Asia, covering a population three times the size of US’. We are headquartered above Tanjong Pagar in Singapore, with a great view and year round warm weather.</p>

<p>Situation:
Alibaba Group has injected two billion dollars into Lazada Group, a South East Asian conglomerate whose logistics arm, Lazada eLogistics (LeL), provides end to end logistics services and acts as a logistics marketplace.</p>

<p>LeL is a data driven business, but the data function is still embryonic. Our CEO and CTO themselves are pushing for the creation of a dedicated data engineering and data science team to take its place at the centre of the company. </p>

<p>A data warehouse project has begun, with 20 systems' backend databases replicated hourly or live into a multi-TB PostgreSQL instance. A ""clean"" (normalised) schema is created from it, a set of views that organises the data into a form that represents the real logic of the business cross-systems. The ""raw"" schema contains all the replicated databases, the ""logical"" schema contains the cross-system normalised information, and we're now building the part that gets from the first to the second. The result will be one of the largest <em>relational</em> PostgreSQL deployment in the world.</p>

<p>The next compulsory steps will be:</p>

<ul>
<li>To complete writing the raw-to-logical mapping, thus modelling and implementing a clean view of all the company's information.</li>
<li>To assist, train, mentor and otherwise lead the existing team into completing the mapping.</li>
<li>To replicate the functional spec of all existing data products within the company (mostly reports).</li>
<li>To expand the team to cover skillsets not currently present or trainable.</li>
<li>To build and provide the ability for the team to answer any question from any part of the business promptly and correctly (such as ""what is the average time a package between 2 and 5kg spends being picked in cold storage zones between 9 and 11am in Thailand and Myanmar a week after Chinese New Year"").</li>
</ul><p>Optional paths thereafter could be:</p>

<ul>
<li>To assist the CEO and CTO with their existing statistical learning projects, such as optimising the routing of millions of packages through multiple transport companies and warehouses internationally.</li>
<li>To think of, develop and deploy other data-driven projects such as optimising warehouse picking operations or inventory management.</li>
<li>To train local teams capable of doing the same independently, and support their efforts. This involves travelling around Asia.</li>
</ul><p>Likely useful experience:</p>

<ul>
<li>Software development (aside from building actual software, you'll need to read a lot of code to understand systems whose logic is not at database level).</li>
<li>A mathematical bend, including awareness of and respect for the ideas behind the relational model (""predicate logic on sets"") as defined by Edgar Codd and Chris Date, and rich data types. If you see a foreign key as a mathematical domain and think in terms of relation values and variables, we are probably on the same page.</li>
<li>Knowing your way around PostgreSQL, or failing that any large scale RDBMS deployment; there are infrastructure teams and DBAs but they need your guidance.</li>
<li>At least some enjoyment of the resolution of large, complex problems using more abstract methods as opposed to quick hacks and duct tape.</li>
<li>UNIX/Linux, but if you've read that far you probably have more than enough experience. </li>
<li>Speaking Chinese (Mandarin) may help a bit but the team has multiple native speakers.</li>
</ul><p>Interview process:</p>

<ul>
<li>Email <a href=""mailto:vanessa.tan@lazada.com"">vanessa.tan@lazada.com</a> to be sent a few quick questions. Include ""6h9mYszLTq2Y"" in the subject line so we know you're not a bot.</li>
<li>An hour or two over Skype for probing your technical experience.</li>
<li>An hour or two in Singapore (if you are there) or over Skype for the C-levels to figure out if they can work with you.</li>

84,Python Developer,Seth Godin,"<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>We're looking for a Python developer to help us continue development of our (mostly) internal-facing web apps. <em>See the current project section for specifics of this gig.</em></p>

<p>What do we do? We teach leadership to high-performing individuals who want to level up (altmba.com), and we teach marketing that you can be proud of because it's ethical, generous, and effective (themarketingseminar.com). </p>

<p>In the process we're trying to change online education. Most online courses have a massive drop-out rate, and don't create an environment that enables the student to grow. </p>

<p>The apps are dashboards and onboarding sites that helps us manage our student experience.</p>

<p>We're looking for someone we can work with long-term, but to start we're going to focus on one new piece of functionality we need to add to the apps.</p>

<p>This is a freelance position, working remotely.</p>

<h1>Current Project</h1>

<p>We need a UI that lets Sam upload a CSV of students, and gives her back a CSV of payment links for each student. </p>

<p>We're currently doing this semi-manually. Alex modifies a few config files and then runs a python script from Heroku's command line. Much of the functionality is already developed. What we need is a bit more functionality to check the CSV to make sure it's formatted correctly, and a UI that let's Sam set the config variables and run the process from the web app. </p>

<h1>Tech Notes</h1>

<p>The app is built using a procedural programming style (not object-oriented).</p>

<p>Since the app is (mostly) internal-facing we value speed and getting to ""good enough,"" more than we care about performance optimization or eliminating all the bugs. This lets us work in a fast, iterative manner. </p>

<p><b>Spreken moderne IT-thema’s zoals domain driven architectuur, continuous delivery, automatic release management en metadata jou aan? Zie jij het als een uitdaging om te participeren in complexe IT-projecten en deze te begeleiden? Wil jij aan de slag in een ongekend groot applicatielandschap?</b><br></p>

<p><b>Wat ga je doen?</b><br></p>

<p>Uit onze laatste sprintreview blijkt dat onze product owners tevreden zijn over onze dienstverlening. We worden daardoor steeds eerder in het proces betrokken en daar zijn we trots op! Vanuit onze ambitie om steeds meer en beter in vaste Scrum teams te gaan werken, vervul jij als Software Architect een cruciale en verbindende rol tussen onze afdeling en de interne klant.<br></p>

<p>In onze state-of-the-art data en informatie infrastructuur in Heerlen bedenk je ontwerpbeslissingen voor de implementatie van gewenste functionaliteit met behulp van de uiteindelijke techniek. Vanuit jouw kennis en kunde, en adviserende rol, kun jij jouw visie overtuigend neerzetten bij product owners en treedt je op als volwaardig gesprekspartner.<br></p>

<p>Als meewerkend voorman neem jij de software engineers mee in jouw werkwijze en vind je het leuk inhoudelijke discussies te voeren, om zo van elkaar te leren.<br></p>

<p>Doordat je een actieve en betrokken rol hebt in grote en complexe projecten, zoals ‘project Datameer’, ben je regelmatig proactief aan de slag met complexe vraagstukken. Enkele van de vraagstukken waar jij je mee bezig mag houden zijn:
<i>Hoe kun je met innovatieve technieken en concepten zoals datavirtualisatie, graph databases, open sourcetools, logical datawarehouse- en metadata concepten en platformen ontwikkelen waarbij statistische data bij de bronnen blijven opgeslagen en op een snelle en eenvoudige manier real-time via een datawebshop ontsloten kunnen worden aan de gebruikers en systemen van het CBS?</i><br></p>

<p>Maar ook:<br><i>Hoe kun je dit platform en concept vervolgens laten uitgroeien tot een platform om data op een veilige maner real-time te delen met externe partijen als overheden, universiteiten, gemeenten en provincies?</i><br></p>

<p>Binnen dit project werk je met open source tools en ben je verantwoordelijk voor het integreren van totaaloplossingen. Hiernaast werk je zelf ook hand-on mee in ontwikkelwerkzaamheden.<br></p>

<p>SENIOR MOBILE DEV (F/M), HAMBURG</p>

<p>The Digital Unit is looking for a talented mobile dev to join our team. In the heart of HafenCity, Hamburg, the Digital Unit is driving the digital transformation at Costa Group (AIDA &amp; Costa Cruises). As a mobile dev with us, you will work with other developers, user experience designers, data analysts and product owners to develop and improve new features while keeping performance, scalability and deployment in mind.</p>

<p>Your code will deploy to and run on the floating cities of the sea - cruise ships. This unique situation calls for a mixed and adaptable set of coding skills. Often the usual taken for granted solutions simply don't work when deployed to a ship. If the sound of this challenge is getting you excited - we'd love to meet you!</p>

<p>THE 'TECH STACK'</p>

<p>We use a variety of technologies to code and ship our products. If Swift for iOS/tvOS, Kotlin for Android or advanced mobile web development tickles your fancy, let's talk! Of course, you're not expected to have mastered it all but deep knowledge of some, along with a hunger to learn new things as needed, is desired.</p>

<p>WHO YOU ARE:</p>

<p>You are an expert in your area, familiar with mobile development challenges as well as sitting down to do some solid functional programming to extend a Backend For Frontend (BFF).
You fancy applying CI/CD techniques and writing automated tests.
You have solid understanding of the full application technology stack, as well as how to handle dropped internet connections in applications.
You could ship an entire mobile app on your own if you wanted to, but prefer working with others to write well-designed, tested, and scalable software in pairs.
You are comfortable communicating in English for coding and in meetings (we try not to have too many).</p>

<p>WHAT WE OFFER:</p>

<p>A bunch of challenges.
A dynamic company culture in the heart of Hamburg in HafenCity.
A team that values the opinions of each member, no matter the role.
A snazzy open office space, with a pro kicker table, conference rooms, a phone booth and a shower.
HVV ProfiTicket discount.
Weekly fresh fruit, free coffee, and water.
Competitive compensation.
If the above describes you and your passions, we look forward to meeting you!</p>

<li>Write high-quality code with some of the smartest engineers in town.</li>
<li>Mentor Stride and client engineers.</li>
<li>Immerse yourself in a learning journey that’s second to none. No where else will you find the variety that being a consultant brings, all a subway ride away.</li>
</ul><p>Day In The Life of a Senior Software Engineer</p>

<p>You are empowered to define what work/life balance means to you. As a Strider, you’ll work onsite at your client. We are proud to call some of NYC’s most outstanding tech teams our clients, from startups to enterprise.  </p>

<p>You will be part of a Stride team, on a client engagement. Your work week will involve 70%-80% client work, including coding, and mentoring Agile engineering best practices.

<pre><code>                                                     Here’s how a day might unfold:
</code></pre>

<p>9am: One-on-one meeting with the client’s CTO.  I’m the engagement lead on my client. I meet with the CTO weekly. We go over the plans for the week and give each other feedback. I take notes so I can relay the info to the team. </p>

<p>10am: Daily Standup. Standup lasts 5 minutes and then we’re off to code.</p>

<p>10:10-12:30 Pair Programming. This morning, I’m pairing with another Strider. She’s been coding 3 years, and she’s got strong fundamentals. We’re doing a deep dive into complex backend code. I’m asking questions when I see she gets stuck. She notices a refactoring opportunity and we jump in. </p>

<p>12:30-1:30 Lunch with my team Every Strider gets a company AmEx. We’re encouraged to grab lunch, coffee with our team and/or client to get to know each other. We talk business for 30 minutes and the rest of the time we talk about rock climbing and a new strategy board game Derek bought last week.</p>

<p>1:30-4:00 Pair Programming</p>

<p>4- 5:Sprint Retrospective Retrospectives on my team are amazing. We take turns facilitating, and today we retrospect our last release. </p>

<p>5-6: Stride U DevOps Jam Stride U is ongoing education for Striders by Striders. Seven of us are taking the DevOps Jam course, it’s 1 hour weekly, for 8 weeks.  DevOps is something I’m dipping a toe in and having a safe space to learn real world stuff that I can bring back to my client is great. </p>

<p>6pm: Leave for the Day. It’s been a good day, I throw on my headphones as I head to the subway. </p>

<pre><code>                                                               What you’ll be doing

We’re looking for a fun, reliable, and highly collaborative, senior dev to join our team.
For reference, here is a list of technologies and tools we are currently actively using on a day-to-day basis:</p>

Alongside this, we also work on the surrounding toolchain, developing new tools for profiling, debugging, documentation and build automation.</p>

<p>We're looking to hire a developer with experience working on compilers to join us. That experience might be from working on a production compiler in industry or from working on research compilers in an academic setting.

132,Leading SAAS Searching for Senior Full-Stack Developer & Project Lead,SixLeaf,"<p><strong>Who We Are:</strong></p>

<p>SixLeaf is the leading marketing platform for third party sellers on Amazon.com as well as a variety of other e-commerce marketplaces. We offer a suite of complete software solutions for brands, both big and small, selling online. These solutions significantly improve marketplace performance and profit for our clients. Simply: we help Brands become ecommerce empires.</p>

<p>Since 2014, our mission has beento help as many brands as possible scale to the point where they are household names. And our goal is to be the very best at it. Since 2014, we’ve established ourselves as the revolutionary innovators in a fast-paced industry. By helping quality brands grow, not only can we assist our clients to achieve their dreams, but we make the market a better place for consumers. Each member of our team shares in the joy and responsibility of making the ecommerce world a better place.</p>

<p><strong>What We Are Looking For:</strong></p>

<p>We are, essentially, looking for a Unicorn, and we understand this. We are searching for a capable, full-stack developer with leadership skills. Our project managers have superior coding capabilities because our projects are complex, and we aren’t looking for a project lead who only understands the lingo.</p>

<p>We need someone who can get into the codebase and get their hands dirty when necessary. The project lead will write the backlog and assign tasks to developers working on the project, but may also help correct complicated issues, and on particularly hairy deadlines, may also assist in coding.</p>

<p>We’re looking for a self-starter and a team player who is able to adapt to a rapidly growing and evolving organization in an industry that moves fast. We’re looking for a leader who can act as a multiplier and makes others around them better through automation, code review, documentation, mentoring when necessary, and who can lead a small team confidently. We’re looking for a true software owner who genuinely cares about the impact our platform makes on the client and their Brand. And we’re looking for the naturally curious developer who doesn’t just accept engineering challenges - they embrace challenges and seek them out.</p>

<p><strong>Why Work With Us?</strong></p>

<p>SixLeaf was originally founded in 2014 as ZonBlast - a tool which completely revolutionized the Amazon marketing space. In the last 4 years, we’ve grown exponentially, have been featured at major industry events, on podcasts, and have proudly served thousands of Brand owners. We’ve had the honor of having a direct hand in taking entrepreneurs from mere idea to 7+ figure Brands.</p>

<p>As a team, we consider working for our early-stage tech startup a lifetyle choice, rather than a job choice. Working for SixLeaf can be challenging at times. We operate in a competitive and fast moving industry, so we need to hit aggressive deadlines and there are many times when everyone on the team puts in a lot more hours than they are used to. You’ll work hard but you’ll face exciting challenges that allow you to put your mark on the world.</p>

<p>As an important part of the SixLeaf team, you’ll be responsible for creating innovative tools that help turn our client’s Brands’ into e-commerce empires. You’ll design beautifully simple yet effective solutions that, once released, will provide measurable and direct impact clients’ businesses.</p>

<p><strong>As a valued SixLeaf team member, you’ll:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Learn Something New</strong>: It is very unlikely you’ve ever worked on a project quite like this. You’ll be exposed to a fascinating and challenging new world where you will be learning about an incredibly exciting industry that is still in its infancy. You will immediately make a difference and impact on SixLeaf, its customers, and this industry.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Make More Money:</strong> To put it bluntly; we are generous. As a startup, we don’t quite have each benchmark that determines bonus structures and pay increases set in stone yet, but we have consistently been extremely giving. We’ve given a bonus each year for the “Christmas” season. We’ve given raises after each 90-day probationary period. We also regularly increase pay based on exemplary performance. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Expand Your Skillset:</strong> You’ll be exposed to developers around the world who each bring a unique set of skills to the table. You’ll also be learning the intricacies of a relatively new industry to the SAAS space, which will require expansion on current knowledge. Overall, you will walk away from this job a more capable and productive individual having learned from the best in the industry.</p></li>
</ul><p>At SixLeaf, and as a fully distributed team, we value respect, transparency, dedication, and innovation. We honor our respective team-members strengths by promoting collaboration.</p>

<p>In addition, we offer:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Generous pay, benefits, and performance-based bonuses</p></li>
<li><p>Generous paid time off policy</p></li>
<li><p>Ability to work remotely in a fully distributed team connected by tools like Slack, Zoom, and more</p></li>
<li><p>Access to a growing library of industry-specific educational material that will help you deliver the best for our clients</p></li>
<li><p>Flexible results-driven schedule</p></li>
<li><p>A team that has cares immeasurably about the results it provides for clients. We take what we do seriously. We know that the results we obtain for clients by way of the software you will help create and improve have direct impacts on entrepreneurs’ businesses, families, and lives. Though we may be distributed, the common drive and connection we all have rivals even </p></li>
</ul><p><strong>What We Need:</strong></p>

<p>Developers are some of the brightest and most amazing people on the planet. However, they can also tend to overcomplicate things. Often, if you ask a developer to turn on a light, he’ll try to build a machine using complex algorithms and a system of wires to engage the light mechanism from their side of the room rather than just walk over to the switch and flip it.</p>

<p>What we need is a project lead that brings balance between genius ideas and common sense solutions. Someone who is nimble, cross-disciplinary, and mindful of client needs. Someone who embraces being a key player in the leadership team. And someone who is results-driven, focused on problem-solving and who can act as a multiplier in any team. If you are an out of the box thinker who loves to invent creative ways to solve problems while also seeing the simplest path, this may be for you.</p>

<p>If you aren’t afraid of hard work and want to be a part of a growing team hell-bent on taking over an entire niche, we may be a fit for each other.</p>

<p><strong>Job Summary:</strong></p>

<p>SixLeaf is searching for a skilled and experienced Information Systems Senior Developer and Project Lead. The ideal candidate will be a quick learner and creative problem solver. We are looking for someone that understands the technologies we use and can follow instructions. However, we also hope this individual can innovate and present more efficient ways to implement our technologies when possible. This candidate should also have management or team lead experience.</p>

<p>Aside from skills, the ideal candidate will also be passionate; about software development, learning new systems and platforms, and about what we do at SixLeaf. We are a rapidly growing force in our industry and hope to find team members as invested in our growth as we are in them.</p>

134,Experienced Software Engineers,Loco2,"<p>Loco2's mission is to make booking trains anywhere in Europe as easy and affordable as possible, from epic international adventures to everyday local commutes. Our booking coverage is unrivalled and growing.</p>

<p>We're looking for 2 experienced Ruby engineers to join our existing team of six, where you'll help us maintain and improve our existing infrastructure, integrate new rail operator booking systems and scale effectively for our rapidly expanding user base.</p>

<p>At Loco2 we care deeply about building an inclusive, open and supportive work environment. We behave with respect for people and the planet and are seeking a diverse range of candidates that share these values.</p>

<p><strong>About us</strong></p>

<p>We're a <a href=""https://loco2.com/team"">small, passionate and cosmopolitan team</a>, with a healthy remote-first culture and an office in London. Our success is built on trust, empathy and shared knowledge, with our users at the centre of what we do. <a href=""https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/loco2.com"">We're proud to have an average rating of 9.3 out of 10 on Trustpilot</a> after 22,000 reviews.</p>

<p>We’ve been selling tickets since 2012 (read our <a href=""https://loco2.com/our-story"">full story here</a>), and we’re growing rapidly as the business matures. Our goal is to scale effectively whilst continuing to delight our users.</p>

<p><em>Why join us?</em></p>

<ul>
<li>We have high codings standards, and follow best practices such as continuous testing and delivery</li>
<li>We strive to learn and improve together in a supportive environment as the wider tech ecosystem evolves</li>
<li>Our team enjoys a healthy work-life balance and don’t think caffeine-fuelled all-nighters are a good way to grow a company that’s built to last</li>
<li>We offer flexible hours and a well-designed remote working culture built on trust. Work around your schedule and when you’re most productive</li>
<li>Our days are not full of meetings and needless distractions, allowing others to achieve flow is a big part of supporting each other</li>
<li>Everyone is encouraged to ask questions, think creatively and suggest new working practices. We have a small team so your voice will be heard</li>
<li>You will be provided with a laptop and are empowered to make changes that improve your working environment</li>
</ul><p><strong>Technical challenges</strong></p>

<p>Our software stack consists of a pure-Ruby backend library which we use to communicate with train booking APIs, a modern Rails application, a PostgreSQL database, and two native mobile applications (iOS and Android).</p>

<p>We’re integrated with multiple rail operator booking systems (with our current team we usually complete at least 1-2 major integrations each year), and we’re increasingly consuming other types of data too (e.g. timetable data for routing, real-time arrivals/departures etc).</p>

<p>We need to diligently manage technical complexity, as each external system works in a slightly different way, with its own features and quirks. SOAP is (unfortunately) used by many operator APIs, which is why we released our open source library, <a href=""https://github.com/loco2/lolsoap"">LolSoap</a>.</p>

<p>Some of the most difficult challenges we face relate to routing and making sense of lots of data. Which routes are best to get from A to B? Which booking systems should be queried? How might we cache data without affecting accuracy of results?</p>

<p>We’ve recently released mobile applications for iOS and Android. Further developing our mobile strategy is a key goal for the business.</p>

<p>Because Loco2 is the merchant of record for all transactions we are also responsible for fraud prevention, and handling currency and other finance-related issues.</p>

<p>We frequently release new features that drive rapid organic growth, and so it’s vital that we anticipate and address scaling challenges before they occur.</p>

<p><strong>About you</strong></p>

<p>An ideal candidate:</p>

<ul>
<li>Has 4+ years of professional programming experience</li>
<li>Has deep knowledge and experience of Ruby</li>
<li>Is fluent in English and confident communicating and sharing complex information and learnings with both technical and non-technical team members</li>
<li>Has a good working knowledge of modern devops technologies such as Docker</li>
<li>Is comfortable designing object oriented software from scratch, not just implementing CRUD Rails apps; a pragmatist who can see the trade-offs involved in the different approaches to solving a problem</li>
<li>Strives to discover and understand the root cause of problems, suggesting new and improved solutions, rather than treating the symptoms</li>
<li>Actively considers future maintainability when deciding how to implement something</li>
<li>Has a keen appetite for self-improvement and growth, but doesn't hesitate to ask for help when needed</li>
<li>Enjoys getting their teeth stuck into complicated problems, as well as being willing to pitch in on some of the more routine tasks which inevitably arise</li>
<li>Is willing to participate in an on-call rota to cover technical emergencies out of hours</li>
<li>Can work hours that have some overlap with London daytime</li>
<li>Is motivated by Loco2's mission</li>

139,Senior Software Engineer -- Javascript,Very LLC,"<p>Interviewing for a new company is a serious time commitment for all parties involved. Please take the time to read this and thoughtfully consider if we would be a good fit for one another. This is a full-time position. You must be located in the continental U.S. No contractors or agencies. Seriously. </p>

<p><strong>Why We Started Very</strong></p>

<p>Not to oversimplify things, but our mission is to become the best IoT, blockchain, and machine learning product development shop in the world. We do this by hiring the best and investing heavily in them, both personally and professionally.</p>

<p><strong>We Fully Embrace Working Remotely</strong></p>

<p>About 30% of our team works out of our HQ in Chattanooga, TN, and the other 70% work remotely from various locations across the United States. We consider ourselves best-practitioners of the remote-first movement and believe a great team shouldn’t be restricted by geography.</p>

<p><strong>What You’ll Be Working On</strong></p>

<p>Very is first and foremost a software consultancy, we tackle hard problems for clients who need a targeted, senior team to come in and provide specific solutions. We are focusing heavily on building out products that have applications in one of the three following areas: 1) data science &amp; machine learning, 2) Internet of Things, and 3) blockchain. We’ve found that in each of these areas, the use of the underlying technology will drive the development of the core services , but that 75% of the work often still lives in the realm of modern web development.</p>

<p>At Very, there is a never ending supply of variety to the types of projects we work on. In the last year we’ve built solutions that touch e-commerce, trust management (finance), beer distribution, point of sale systems, ICO’s, identifying fake news, and much more.</p>

<p>You’ll spend 80% of your week (Monday through Thursday) designing and building a product or platform for one of our clients. The other 20% of your week (Friday) will be spent contributing to our open source projects, internal products, learning, teaching, and participating in internal operations of all flavors. </p>

<p>Project teams are small and usually made up of one or two pairs of engineers, a UX engineer, a product manager, and the client who serves as the product owner. We spend most of our time building new products, with the goal of helping our clients take it to market. We are often further engaged by our clients to continue iterating on the product once it is live. The high cost of context switching is real, so we do our best to keep teams together throughout the duration of their projects (typically 3-6 months), but have found it valuable to rotate pairing partners when it makes reasonable sense. </p>

<p>We are always exploring new tools, languages, and technologies. We feel strongly that it’s a good idea to use the best tool for the job and not see everything as a nail. We also try our best to standardize our technology and tooling across project teams so it’s easier to rotate and practice collective code ownership. We are currently building products and platforms using the following tools / platforms:</p>

<ul>
<li>React &amp; React Native</li>
<li>Swift &amp; Objective C</li>
<li>Elixir,  Phoenix, and Nerves</li>
<li>Arduino (embedded C/C++)</li>
<li>Ethereum / Solidity</li>
<li>Ruby on Rails</li>
<li>Python</li>
<li>Pandas</li>
<li>Serverless</li>
<li>AWS (and a dash of Heroku where it makes sense)</li>
</ul><p>Given that we work on quite a bit of greenfield projects, there is often room to experiment with new patterns and tools (within reason). We don’t expect applicants to know our entire toolchain, but rather to be capable, flexible, and self-directed.</p>

<p><strong>This Role:  Senior Software Engineer // Javascript</strong></p>

<p>Over the past few years, we’ve seen client-side engineering emerge as its own discipline, and we are looking for individuals who thrive in the front end and want to further their practice. Ideal candidates not only have a solid engineering background, but a passion for client-side development as well. 
We value well-tested, reusable code and expect our engineers to be as good of practitioners as they are leaders and teachers. </p>

<p><strong>How We Operate</strong></p>

<p>We are believers in transparency and openness. In terms of organizational structure and governance, we are a holacracy. It’s worked pretty well for the us the last few years. When it comes to development processes, we do our best to adhere as closely to Extreme Programming as possible. We believe in hiring capable, responsible professionals. We don’t micromanage and trust everyone to work hard, experiment, learn from their mistakes, and contribute to each other and the company in a sustainable manner. We have no venture funding or external investors, which affords us the ability to be nimble and run our company in the best interest of our team as a whole.   </p>

<p><strong>How You’ll Be Compensated</strong></p>

<p>We believe in a transparent, fair compensation structure and have developed our own open salary formula.

<li>Document code clearly and thoroughly, so others can maintain and support the code. Document new configuration or processes, and keep all documentation up to date.</li>

155,Humbly Confident Senior Mobile Developer,YNAB (You Need A Budget),"<p>At YNAB, we build the world’s best budgeting software. But we’re even prouder of teaching people how to align their money and their priorities, and in turn changing their lives.</p>

<p>We have big plans for our iOS and Android apps. In the Summer of 2017 we brought most of the functionality of the web app to our mobile apps, and now we’re looking to take them even further.</p>

<p>If you’re the one we’re looking for, you have extensive experience with iOS or Android and are excited to help us with <em>both</em> platforms. Heck, you’re also excited about getting to work with the TypeScript and SQL we use in our shared library. This isn’t your first rodeo. You’ve got 5 or more years of experience, and can point to multiple applications you have helped ship.</p>

<p>That’s a super-brief intro of what you’ll be working on. But first, you need to know if you’ll even like working with us. We think you will.</p>

<p><strong>A Bit About Us</strong></p>

<p>We build the best budgeting software around, YNAB or “You Need a Budget” if you have a lot of extra time on your hands. For more than a decade, people have been buying YNAB and then telling their friends what a difference it has made in their lives. (Google us, and you’ll see what we mean.) We love building something that has a huge positive impact on people’s lives.</p>

<p>We’re profitable, bootstrapped, and growing. YNAB started in 2004 and we haven’t taken any outside funding—we’re in it for the long haul.</p>

<p>We have one overarching requirement when it comes to joining our team: our Cultural Manifesto has to really click with you. If you’re nodding emphatically while reading it, you’ll probably fit right in!</p>

<p>First, let’s talk about life at YNAB and then we’ll go into detail about what we’re looking for.</p>

<p><strong>Who you’d be working with:</strong></p>

<p>Our developer team is 12 people strong, but we all work pretty closely. For that matter, we also work in cross-functional teams frequently so you'll get to work with people in all different roles in the company. As a small sampling though, here are a few that you'll definitely rub digital shoulders with:</p>

<p>Taylor, our CTO, was our digital nomad for a couple of years while he travelled...pretty much everywhere. He's now slowing down a bit and lives in Austin Texas, where he's learning to flex his handyman muscles while renovating their home. He's exceptionally good at escape room games and his super skill is explaining the rules of a board game in the most concise and understandable way you've ever heard. He also wins a lot of those board games.</p>

<p>Sebastian, our mobile lead developer, works mostly on the iOS side of things here at YNAB. When he's not busy at YNAB he's either out walking the dogs, pretending to be a firefighter, feeding the cats or playing with his new server rack in the barn. He lives in rural Switzerland which might explain the barn - and by rural we mean it'd take you an hour to get to Zurich.</p>

<p>Graham, our Android tech lead, is on a mission to convert everything to RxJava and Kotlin, and is constantly dabbling with various architecture patterns and solutions for cross-platform code-sharing. He lives in Scotland, where he hopes to one day be a decent enough guitarist to play a tune and actually have someone recognize it.</p>

<p>He's an aviation geek who obsessively binge-watches entire seasons of Air Crash Investigations, just in case it might come in useful someday.</p>

<p><strong>How You’ll Work at YNAB</strong></p>

<p>We work really hard to make working at YNAB an amazing experience. We have a team full of truly exceptional people—the kind you’ll be excited to work with. Here’s how we operate:</p>

<p><strong>Live Where You Want.</strong>
We’re a distributed team, so you can live and work wherever you want. Proximity doesn’t influence productivity. Just make sure you have a reliable internet connection.</p>

<p><strong>No Crazy Hours.</strong>
We rarely work more than 40 hours per week. There have been a few occasions where things got a little crazy and people had to log some extra hours. But then they took some extra time off, so it all balances out. We work hard and smart but we’re in this for the long haul, no need to go crazy on the hours.</p>

<p><strong>Take Vacation (Seriously).</strong>
We want you to take vacation. In fact, we have a minimum vacation policy of three weeks per year (plus two extra weeks for Christmas break). It’s important to get out and do something. We’ll look forward to seeing pictures of your vacation in our internal chat room, creatively named #office_wall.</p>

<p><strong>The YNAB Retreat.</strong>
We get the teams together once a year to catch up on spreadsheets and powerpoints in a Best Western conference room. Just kidding. So far, we’ve done Costa Rica, a gigantic cabin in the mountains, and a beach house in the Outer Banks. This year is a ranch in Montana. We do really fun things, but the highlight is always just hanging out together and having a blast.</p>

<p><strong>Up Your Game.</strong>
We’re serious about helping you improve your craft. We budget for it (hey-o!).. Think conferences, Lynda subscriptions, books, dedicated time away from work to learn something new... it’s really up to you and your manager. But we love to see our people growing.  </p>

<p><strong>If You’re International...</strong>
You’ll be set up as a contractor. Employee or contractor, it’s all the same to us. You’re part of the team. As for time zones, we’re flexible as long as a decent chunk of your time overlaps with North American time zones.</p>

<p><strong>If You’re Stateside…</strong>
You’ll be a W2 employee with fantastic health, dental, and vision insurance, where we cover 100% of the premium for you and your family. (No need to check your vision, you read that right, 100%. Although if you did need to check your vision, no big deal, we’ve got you covered!)</p>

<p>We also have Traditional and Roth 401k options. YNAB contributes three percent whether you choose to throw any money in there or not. It vests immediately. (Are you a personal finance junkie like Jesse? He set up YNAB’s 401k to have the lowest fee structure possible, where all plan costs are paid by YNAB, not your retirement nest egg. The investment funds available are fantastic, passively-managed, ultra low-cost index funds. You’re not a PF junkie? Then trust us, it’s great.)</p>

<p><strong>Other Tidbits</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Once you start, we DEMAND (in a friendly, ALL CAPS IS YELLING way) that you fill out your “Bucket List” spreadsheet with 50 items. (That’s harder than it sounds!)</li>
<li>The bucket list helps in deciding what we should give you for your birthday and Christmas: No gift cards here. We tried that. Super boring.</li>
<li>We have a bonus plan based on profitability. You’ll be in on that from day one. YNAB wins, you win. That kind of thing.</li>
<li>We’re all adults. There’s no need to punch a clock, or ask for permission to take off early one afternoon to go see the doctor (health insurance premium 100% covered!). We look at what you’re accomplishing, not how long you sit (have you tried standing?) in front of a computer.</li>
<li>We want you firing on all cylinders so we’ll set you up with a shiny new computer and replace it every three years.</li>
<li>Did I mention we make a huge, positive difference in people’s lives? We have a Slack channel where we share success stories from our customers daily. It’s amazing. Don’t underestimate this one!</li>
</ul><p>If this sounds like your ideal environment, read on because now I want to talk about you. You will play a big part in helping YNAB delight users and give them control of their money.  You will change lives. </p>

<p><strong>Now, back to you, our new Mobile Developer…</strong></p>

<p>You're a mobile developer with over 5 years of experience. At least two of those have been spent working with either iOS or Android, or both. (If you have experience with only one, you’re excited to work with the other. We love both platforms for different reasons, and want you to as well.)  You know how to write easy-to-maintain software while still keeping an eye on the roadmap.</p>

<p>You'll help us implement new features and maintain existing apps on both iOS and Android. We have native implementations for each platform but use a shared library based on TypeScript for things that, well, need to be shared across platforms. For performance and maintainability reasons there is plenty of SQL code as well. You don't have to be an expert on TypeScript or SQL, but being curious about how things work on that layer will definitely help. Our baselines are Lollipop on Android and iOS 9 on iOS. You'll get to work with things like Kotlin and RxJava on Android. On iOS you'll work with Objective-C and Swift on a universal app and an Apple watch app.</p>

<p><strong>You’re the one we’re looking for if you:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Are an excellent developer and can adapt to new languages quickly.</li>
<li>Write code that is easy for other programmers to understand and use.</li>
<li>Have excellent debugging skills. You know how to find problems, and how to architect apps so that problems are discoverable in the first place.</li>
<li>Are self-motivated and thrive with directions like:
""This part of the program is too slow, and these are the places that might be good to start looking.""<br>
""This component needs to be re-architected to allow for X. How do you think we should do it?""
“Our code needs to call into a Javascript library, but that Javascript library is crashing because it can’t find the setTimeout method. Can you investigate?”</li>
<li>Are excited to work across multiple platforms with different technologies.</li>
<li>Have experience with:
Kotlin / Java
Or
Swift / Objective-C</li>
<li>Have shipped or helped ship at least one significant app for either iOS or Android.</li>
<li>Are a senior developer who can point to strong experience where you’ve exemplified the bullet points above.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Bonus Point:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>You already use and love YNAB.</li>
</ul><p>Salary will be between $90k and $125k, depending on experience.</p>

<p>And, since our job descriptions are already so long, what’s another sentence or two…</p>

<p>YNAB is an equal opportunity employer. We believe diversity of backgrounds, beliefs, and experiences to be critical to our success and are passionate about creating a welcoming, supportive, and collaborative environment for all employees.

<p>At Mayfield Robotics, we make home robots that are joyful, useful, and inspiring. We move fast, we like and respect each other, and we have some very big ambitions. And we’re still growing.</p>

<p>We operate with all the best aspects of being a startup: independence, speed, transparency, teamwork, and a well-stocked kitchen. We also have the focus and discipline of a company that knows exactly where it’s going, without the distraction of fundraising (we’re wholly owned by a much larger company that loves what we’re doing, thinks long term, and mostly leaves us alone). We were founded in February of 2015, and we’re based in sunny Redwood City, California - the epicenter of both Silicon Valley and the future of robotics.</p>

<p>About the Role:</p>

<p>Do you like robots? As you know, they still can’t manufacture themselves. But if you do well enough at this, you could put yourself out of a job by making that a reality!</p>

<p>Mayfield’s Manufacturing team is increasing the capacity of our robot factory. We need someone to guide the software facet of building robots to ensure smooth deliveries to our eager customers. The goal is to ensure a smooth production line. This includes making sure the test stations on the line function properly, get updated securely and scale effectively to meet our throughput targets. You will ensure the correct software is put on each robot before it ships to a customer. Additionally, you will be responsible for collecting all the data from all the stations, getting the data into the correct systems and making sure the data is correct and complete so that the complete lifecycle of the robot can be tracked. There is no glory here: If you excel at your job, things will just work.</p>

<p>Come help us meet our excited customers demand for cute, adorable home robots and be on the forefront of mass produced robots.</p>

<p>Responsibilities:</p>

<pre><code>Bridge the gap between Mayfield’s Manufacturing and Software teams
Help Manufacturing Engineers turn requirements into high-quality software
Document and create a maintainable way to keep manufacturing line up to date and reproducible
Work with Test Engineers to develop reliable subassembly and end-of-line tests

182,"Software Engineer, Platform",VigLink,"<p>About VigLink:</p>

<p>At VigLink, we believe the future of marketing lies within the untapped potential of digital content covering commercial products across the Web. We empower influential publishers who produce this content to connect enthusiastic consumers with the products they love from the brands who value them the most. We accomplish this directly through publishers’ words, without need for an ad.</p>

<p>By identifying commercial products mentioned within a publisher’s content, VigLink automatically invigorates those terms by transforming them into hyperlinks whose destinations are determined in real-time, advertiser-bid auctions. Yes, hyperlinks, the defining feature of the Web from the very start. The literal “H” in HTML. Every time a clicked link takes a person from one destination to another, value is created. However, that value has never been fairly priced or available for purchase at scale. Until now.</p>

<p>Founded in 2009, VigLink is located in heart of San Francisco and backed by top investors including Google Ventures, Emergence Capital, and RRE. VigLink manages a publisher network of over 2 million sites and apps, as well as an advertiser network of over 70,000 brands and merchants.</p>

200,Senior Data Scientist / Machine Learning Engineer,VigLink,"<p>About VigLink:</p>

<p>At VigLink, we believe the future of marketing lies within the untapped potential of digital content covering commercial products across the Web. We empower influential publishers who produce this content to connect enthusiastic consumers with the products they love from the brands who value them the most. We accomplish this directly through publishers’ words, without need for an ad.</p>

<p>By identifying commercial products mentioned within a publisher’s content, VigLink automatically invigorates those terms by transforming them into hyperlinks whose destinations are determined in real-time, advertiser-bid auctions. Yes, hyperlinks, the defining feature of the Web from the very start. The literal “H” in HTML. Every time a clicked link takes a person from one destination to another, value is created. However, that value has never been fairly priced or available for purchase at scale. Until now.</p>

<p>Founded in 2009, VigLink is located in heart of San Francisco and backed by top investors including Google Ventures, Emergence Capital, and RRE. VigLink manages a publisher network of over 2 million sites and apps, as well as an advertiser network of over 70,000 brands and merchants.</p>

<p>About the role:</p>

<p>VigLink is seeking a Data Scientist or Machine Learning Engineer with strong Hadoop, Hive and SQL skills, and experience creating production-quality code in Python, R, or other related languages. We are looking for folks who enjoy working on a variety of different types of analyses, ranging from ad-hoc ""data wrangling"" tasks through the creation of full-blown programs to calculate business-critical, customer-visible values on an ongoing basis, enjoy thinking through a data problem, understanding the customer needs associated with it, and working on your own and with other developers to create a pragmatic solution.</p>

<p>At VigLink we love go-getters and people who like working in an Agile, best-practices environment - who understand the importance of testable, modular, efficient code, so that's what you write.</p>

<p>Required Qualifications:</p>

<p>Minimum of 3 years experience in relevant analytics tasks with strong Python, R, Matlab, or related language<br>
Experience training and implementing supervised and/or unsupervised learning models <br>
Solid understanding of databases and SQL<br>
Capacious curiosity for data and algorithms, and how to apply them to create insight<br>
Experience with Linux/Unix—you are comfortable on the command line<br>
Experience in the e-commerce, web analytics, search, and cloud computing space<br>
BA/BS degree in Computer Science preferred with a strong academic record (MS/PhD or equivalent a plus)</p>

<p>Preferred Qualifications:</p>

<p>NLP experience particularly with concepts such as document classification, named entity recognition/disambiguation, and topic modelling<br>
Experience with Java, or a JVM based language like Scala<br>
Experience with the Hadoop ecosystem, particularly Pig and Hive</p>

<p>A few fun problems we're working on:</p>

<p>Feature Extraction and Context / Product Inference
Identify the commercial context of publisher content, identify the relevance of commercial links to that content, and match relevant destinations to appropriate products / services available across the web.</p>

<p>Statistical Modeling and Prediction of Earnings
Model the performance of our existing publishers and merchants to predict future performance at high granularity.</p>

<p>Large-Data Analytics and Audience Profiling
Develop automated insights that help publishers improve their performance by developing a better understanding of their audiences based on billions of impressions and tens of millions of clicks per week. Do this for thousands of publishers in a scalable and relevant way.</p>

<p>Destination Optimization
Select the most appropriate destination for a commercial link, based on what is best for the viewer and the publisher. Balance estimated publisher earnings (based on earnings per click, location, device type, etc) with viewer relevance and good viewer experience.
Relocation and travel expenses not covered.  </p>

204,Software Engineer,Azavea,"<p>Overview</p>

<p>Azavea is a civic technology firm based in Philadelphia that uses geospatial data to build software and data analytics for the web.  As a B Corporation, our mission is to use advanced geospatial technology for civic, social, and environmental impact. Most of our work deals with local governments, non-profit organizations, and academic or federal research projects.  We build custom web applications, perform geospatial analysis, and contribute to open source projects.  Our engineers work across the technology stack, from modern browser-based front-ends to robust service-based backends residing on scalable infrastructure.</p>

<p>We are looking for a Software Engineer who is passionate about building and operating applications that will have a positive impact. Ideal candidates are interested in public service, but not necessarily in working for a government or a non-profit organization.</p>

<p>We’re excited about what we do, we’re growing, and we hope you will join us.</p>

<p>Skills &amp; Requirements</p>

<p>Azavea has five software teams, all of which develop web software for processing and visualizing geospatial data.  The teams differ in terms of the specific projects they develop and whether they are primarily product or service focussed. The GeoTrellis team develops an open source software framework that enables low latency, distributed processing of geospatial data; the majority of our work is currently funded by the U.S. Federal government. The project is based on Scala and Apache Spark. It is used in many types of web applications, including processing satellite imagery, climate change, precision agriculture, public transit travel-sheds, and watershed modeling. GeoTrellis is a member of the Eclipse Foundation’s LocationTech working group. A significant focus of the past year has been developing Python Bindings in an effort to expand the pool of developers that can benefit from GeoTrellis. GeoTrellis is growing, and we need your help to expand the framework and make it more useful to other developers.</p>

<p>What You’ll Do
Build scalable back-end software where performance is critical.
Implement new features, algorithms, data processing operations, benchmarks and tests for a large Scala-based software framework.
Engage in multidisciplinary work that applies an agile process (scrum board, daily stand-ups and two-week iterations) to design, architecture, development, testing and deployment.
Support the development of an open source community around the GeoTrellis project.
Contribute to both a growing company and to the open source communities that support our work.</p>

<p>You should
Demonstrate fluency with at least one functional programming language such as Scala, Clojure or Haskell.
Be able to adapt and lean in order to keep innovating on a cutting edge open source project.
Have experience with Amazon Web Service  or another cloud-based architecture.
Interested in working with a small, collaborative team on meaningful projects.
Get excited about contributing to a large, complex open source project.</p>

<p>You get extra points for
Experience with Spark, Akka, or other Scala-based distributed processing frameworks.
Having worked with distributed data processing frameworks, like Hadoop, Amazon MR, etc.
Demonstrating your open source or other community service contributions.
Strong background in algorithm development where performance is critical.</p>

<p>You’ll notice that we don’t cite N years of experience or a Computer Science as requirements.  Formal credentials like these are valuable, but we are primarily looking for people who have gained real-world experience successfully building sophisticated web applications.  </p>

<p>Office and Benefits</p>

<p>Our Philadelphia headquarters is located in a brightly lit office on the 5th floor of a converted factory building in the Callowhill neighborhood, a short walk from Center City, the Reading Terminal Market, and SEPTA subway and regional rail stations.

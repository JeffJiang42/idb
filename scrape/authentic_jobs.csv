7,Client Care Specialist_30374,Precision Nutrition,"Do you have the ability to read into a question and really understand what someone is asking? Does ‘making someone's day' get you out of bed in the morning? Do you want to work with a company that really makes a difference in the lives of others?
We are looking for a rockstar Client Care Specialist to join our team and provide superior customer service that exceeds our client's expectations.
What You'll be Doing
You get to work from home with an amazing team of Client Care Specialists that care deeply about building and strengthening our client relationships. You will educate clients on our products and respond to tough (and not-so-tough) inquiries through email using Desk.com and on live chat using Intercom.io. You will also make the occasional phone call. Yep, you'll be responding to LOTS of people and putting smiles on their faces all day. That takes a certain kind of person. If that's you...read on.
Our Ideal Candidate
Knows their stuff. This can't be your first rodeo. You have at least 2 years of experience in a web-based, service oriented company providing customer support where email and live chat were your primary responsibilities.
Can read between the lines. Sometimes a client's question isn't always obvious, and I'm sure you know, a lot can get lost in 'email' translation. A client may be asking for one thing, and really need something else. You have an uncanny ability to read into what they are looking for, ask the right questions, and exceed their expectations by responding to their real question.
Has great sleuthing skills. You are able to do your own detective work and find clues with the tools you have access to. You never pass on a case without first trying to piece the puzzle together.
Is an exceptional communicator. You know how to get your message across clearly and concisely to different audiences, through the written word. You are a skilled writer and have outstanding proofreading skills. Yup, you're a natural here.
Embraces sales. You understand that part of your role is to be a frontline salesperson and you see this as an important part of how you approach your work.
Cares. You are an empathetic advocate for our clients. You recognize that through email, you are building relationships, making our customers feel cared for, and quickly solving problems if an experience doesn't go 100% as planned. You care about our clients having accurate information and are getting their issues resolved.
Is thorough and obsessed with the details. You are careful, cautious, and incredibly meticulous; some may even call you nitpicky - in an endearing way, of course! And, you dream about dotting the i's and crossing the t's. Nothing slips by the net when you're goalie.
Is comfortable with frequent pivots. You have the ability to prioritize and re-prioritize your work in a fast-changing environment - you understand that things change as new information is made available. You don't mind shifting gears and are skilled at having a few balls up in the air at one time.
Is committed to their craft. You were meant to be in Client Care. It is your unique ability. It's not a stepping stone to join PN or to gain some experience to launch another career. You care about people and want to be sure they have everything they need to make the right decision for themselves and get their questions answered.
Has the ability to work independently and can ramp up quickly, for more intense periods of work. Once you are confident in what you need to do, you can run with it and don't need a lot of direction. That said, you are not on an island. You'll get plenty of help and support from the team when you need it and when it gets busy during launch periods and the team needs you - you'll jump right in.
Leaves their ego at the door. You have integrity, talent, are outgoing, have a palpable excitement about the future, and don't show it off. Shadiness, mediocrity, cynicism, and excessive 'constructive criticism' are out.
Wants to be part of a purpose-driven organization. PN is a pretty incredible place and is committed to allowing you to do the work you love and love the work you do.
Life-changing, research-driven nutrition coaching. That's our mission at Precision Nutrition.
As an organization, we:

Seek and support diversity.
Offer 4 weeks paid time-off, benefits, and the ability to work remotely.
Set you up with whatever fancy gear you need to perform at your best.
Give you the flexibility to make your own schedule.

Not only that, but if you join us you can:

Work in the fitness and nutrition industry. We love exercise, we love nutrition, and we love sport. That's why we started this company. If you do too, you'll appreciate how rare it is to find a career you really love. For active, fit people, Precision Nutrition is that opportunity.
Work with fun, bright, and talented people. We're a small company, and we're picky about who we work with, because to us, this isn't just a job; it's our life.

If you or someone you know is interested in the position we welcome you to apply below. Please only apply if you are committed to the Client Care field.

21,Full-Stack Web Developer with WordPress Experience_30410,Advant Interactive,"We are Advant Interactive, a group of design and developer nerds. We’re a small bunch so far but we have plans for world domination. We’re based in Long Beach, just a Kobe 3-pointer from the beach, and a taxi ride from the heart of LA. We are on the lookout for an individual who seeks a position at the cutting edge of web development. All candidates must work with speed and enjoy sweating over tight deadlines. They must live to code and not be happy until they’ve seen a project through from insemination to birth to that first day at kindergarten.
Who are you? The dude (or dudette) for the role should have a minimum of two years in the world of web development, with a portfolio that’s likely to blow our socks off.
Because we live in the virtual world, it does not matter where you reside, as long as you are available during business hours. Still reading?
Can you tick these boxes?
Ã¢ÂÂ You are a Wordpress Whiz and have extensive knowledge/experience with front-end work.
Ã¢ÂÂ You’re a dab hand in JavaScript/jQuery (If you can write plugins as well then that’s a bonus, but you must be able to write and implement small-to-medium scripts at least)
Ã¢ÂÂ You’re an old pro in writing raw HTML and CSS (especially HTML5 and CSS3)
Ã¢ÂÂ You are experienced working with PHP tasks
Ã¢ÂÂ You’re used to developing in a LAMP environment
Ã¢ÂÂ You’re on-the-button with current Web standards, optimization techniques and best practices
Ã¢ÂÂ You’re full of knowledge regarding Twitter Bootstrap and Foundation
Ã¢ÂÂ You’re a web developer with two or more years of professional industry experience

Since the launch of Rebadge, literally hundreds of thousands of people have been able to make copies of their badges, and the number increases every day.
Each machine is an embedded linux system running Python + Qt, and tethered online.Supporting the machines is a RESTful API (CakePHP).There is also a full back-office system for client management, machine management, billing, etc.
We've got over 2,000 machines online (Check out our coverage map here: https://rebadge.eu)

Company
Common Networks was founded on the idea that everyone should have a choice for fast, affordabe access to broadband internet. Right now, most homes in the U.S. don't, in fact 62% of homes live in a monopoly broadband market. High-speed access unlocks all the superpowers on the internet. When it works, it can be a great leveling force across the world, giving everyone access to educational tools, entertainment, immediate translations, or even medical care that they wouldn't otherwise have.
Common Networks provides surburban neighborhoods with internet using wireless technology. We interconnect homes in a neighborhood, creating a mesh network between homes and our fiber internet sources. A whole community can then have fast and reliable internet service with only a few  locations needing fiber access.
Role
We are looking to hire our first Product Designer. The primary function of this role is UX/UI design, but this role will also be flexible to do some visual design and marketing design. As the first designer, you will have heavy influence over our overall brand and product experience. We are seeking a designer who can use design thinking, product design, and visual design to help achieve our company-level goals. We care deeply about our customer experience and believe that crafting and honing this experience is what sets us apart from the incumbent ISPs that exist today.
What you do

Problem-solve with the product and engineering teams to come up with solutions for problems/challenges across our entire platform
Build designs for products and features for a number of different audiences: internal users, field technicians, and our internet subscribers
Work cross-functionally with engineers, field operations team, and product managers to implement features
You are the voice of design at the company and help to hold us to a high bar of design excellence

Who you are 

You care first and foremost about creating an awesome user experience, no matter who the customer is. To that end, you know how to balance aesthetics, functionality and practicality.

Collaborative team member.  You are open, honest, and can respectfully work through difficult problems with the rest of the team.
Clear communicator. You have many audiences - engineers, designers, operations team, our board of directores, etc. You know how to structure written and verbal communications clearly for each audience.

Detail oriented. You sweat the small stuff and don't let things slip through the cracks. You understand the difference between letting something slip through the cracks vs. actively deprioritizing an edge case.
Naturally curious and have a self-starter personality with hustle. You don't need to wait for people to tell you what to work on. You know that done is better than perfect and are engergized by constantly delivering and moving things forward. You roll up your sleeves and do whatever it takes to make things successful.

39,Product Designers at multiple levels_30321,WeTransfer,"Every day, millions of people rely on WeTransfer to share their creative ideas. So, the work we do matters. Come and be a part of it.
Our approach to design
WeTransfer aims to build simple tools around people’s creative process, on any device. We’re interested in the weird and wonderful ways that creative minds work, and how they shape the world around us. This thinking has made our products and brand loved by anyone – from our moms to your favorite artists. As we grow, the simplicity of our service will be challenged. It is our responsibility to design and deliver delightful experiences that continue to feel obvious and intuitive to millions of people every day.
What you’ll be doing
As a product designer, you will work side-by-side with engineers and a product manager in a product team. Teams work autonomously, owning their part of the experience. You’ll be responsible for the design of that experience and act as a creative and strategic partner for your teammates. This work is supported by a range of specialists to make sure design decisions are well-informed and that you have everything needed to take WeTransfer to the next level.
Product design at WeTransfer spans from subtle tweaks that make a difference, to innovation projects that define our products’ future. You’ll work to improve, expand on and push the WeTransfer experience forward; designing elegant flows and interactions, testing solutions with prototypes, iterating to reach product objectives, maintaining our design system — all across web, mobile and desktop applications, and through product integrations. Every week you’ll get together with a group of designers to present and review work.
We take pride in building tools that enable creativity to flow. This has shaped the experience we’ve built, the way we work, and how we view our organization. Through our monthly Innovation Fridays, anyone in the company can work together to explore that outlook and what’s next for WeTransfer.
Qualities we’ll be looking for

We value smarts and an inquisitive attitude. You’ll deal with quite a bit of complexity, and should be comfortable with ambiguity and abstraction.
WeTransfer is part of the creative community and so are you — broadly interested in tech, culture, and the arts.
You love to learn, unlearn, and relearn. In this rapidly changing world, it’s imperative to keep evolving. You are an experienced designer, with a relevant education and some (or many) years on the ground.
You demonstrate a product mindset. Shipping product is key, that means you’re happy to experiment and prototype, eager to talk to users, quick to sketch out ideas and you know how to get your design through development.
You articulate your ideas effectively through your verbal and written communication skills. Proficiency in the English language is required.
Our products are used by all kinds of amazing people, from all over the world. We actively look to have this diversity reflected in our teams.
Our product teams work from our Amsterdam office. You should either live within a commutable distance, or willing to relocate (we'll help you make the move, some conditions apply for visa applications).
We are growing rapidly and looking to fill several positions at multiple levels. We’d love for you to get in touch if you’re ready for the next step in your career, working with an amazing team to create meaningful products for millions of people every day. Ã°ÂÂÂ

What we are looking for

You have 5+ years of relevant experience
You’ve designed and shipped mobile and web products. Experience specific to media or publishing is a plus.
You enjoy both details of the craft and deliberate, long-term systems thinking. You enjoy perfecting typography just as much as creating a component library.

Atlantic Media Values:Across Atlantic Media, generally, the firm looks for two “pillar gifts” in you, and everyone else.  In all of us, these are more aspirational than actual, but they are central in our intentions –
Force of Ideas:  At the center of Atlantic Media work are the ideas within our writing.  We believe that ideas – to the good and not – have consequence.  Our highest work is bringing rigor, insight, intellectual honesty, to that ultimate purpose of separating the bad from the good, and giving voice to the latter.Spirit of Generosity:  Atlantic Media seeks in its ranks a spirit of generosity – a natural disposition in each colleague toward service and selfless conduct.  Atlantic Media writing should be cut from the same cloth –critical on the merits but informed by charity and forbearance in measuring motive and personal character.

56,Senior Software Engineer JavaScript_30343,Very,"Interviewing for a new company is a serious time commitment for all parties involved. Please take the time to read this and thoughtfully consider if we would be a good fit for one another. This is a full-time position. You must be located in the continental U.S. No contractors or agencies. Seriously.
Why We Started Very
Not to oversimplify things, but our mission is to become the best IoT, blockchain, and machine learning product development shop in the world. We do this by hiring the best and investing heavily in them, both personally and professionally.
We Fully Embrace Working Remotely
About 30% of our team works out of our HQ in Chattanooga, TN, and the other 70% work remotely from various locations across the United States. We consider ourselves best-practitioners of the remote-first movement and believe a great team shouldn’t be restricted by geography.
What You’ll Be Working On
Very is first and foremost a software consultancy, we tackle hard problems for clients who need a targeted, senior team to come in and provide specific solutions. We are focusing heavily on building out products that have applications in one of the three following areas: 1) data science & machine learning, 2) Internet of Things, and 3) blockchain. We’ve found that in each of these areas, the use of the underlying technology will drive the development of the core services , but that 75% of the work often still lives in the realm of modern web development.
At Very, there is a never ending supply of variety to the types of projects we work on. In the last year we’ve built solutions that touch e-commerce, trust management (finance), beer distribution, point of sale systems, ICO’s, identifying fake news, and much more.
You’ll spend 80% of your week (Monday through Thursday) designing and building a product or platform for one of our clients. The other 20% of your week (Friday) will be spent contributing to our open source projects, internal products, learning, teaching, and participating in internal operations of all flavors.
Project teams are small and usually made up of one or two pairs of engineers, a UX engineer, a product manager, and the client who serves as the product owner. We spend most of our time building new products, with the goal of helping our clients take it to market. We are often further engaged by our clients to continue iterating on the product once it is live. The high cost of context switching is real, so we do our best to keep teams together throughout the duration of their projects (typically 3-6 months), but have found it valuable to rotate pairing partners when it makes reasonable sense.
We are always exploring new tools, languages, and technologies. We feel strongly that it’s a good idea to use the best tool for the job and not see everything as a nail. We also try our best to standardize our technology and tooling across project teams so it’s easier to rotate and practice collective code ownership. We are currently building products and platforms using the following tools / platforms:


React & React Native


Swift & Objective C


Elixir, Phoenix, and Nerves


Arduino (embedded C/C++)


Ethereum / Solidity


Ruby on Rails


Python


Pandas


Serverless


AWS (and a dash of Heroku where it makes sense)


Given that we work on quite a bit of greenfield projects, there is often room to experiment with new patterns and tools (within reason). We don’t expect applicants to know our entire toolchain, but rather to be capable, flexible, and self-directed.
This Role: Senior Software Engineer // Javascript
Over the past few years, we’ve seen client-side engineering emerge as its own discipline, and we are looking for individuals who thrive in the front end and want to further their practice. Ideal candidates not only have a solid engineering background, but a passion for client-side development as well.
We value well-tested, reusable code and expect our engineers to be as good of practitioners as they are leaders and teachers.
How We Operate
We are believers in transparency and openness. In terms of organizational structure and governance, we are a holacracy. It’s worked pretty well for the us the last few years. When it comes to development processes, we do our best to adhere as closely to Extreme Programming as possible. We believe in hiring capable, responsible professionals. We don’t micromanage and trust everyone to work hard, experiment, learn from their mistakes, and contribute to each other and the company in a sustainable manner. We have no venture funding or external investors, which affords us the ability to be nimble and run our company in the best interest of our team as a whole.
How You’ll Be Compensated
We believe in a transparent, fair compensation structure and have developed our own open salary formula. Depending on your skill and experience, you can expect to make somewhere between $80,000 and $135,000 upon joining the company. We have many health plans available through UHC—prices and plans vary based on your region—as well as vision and dental. We currently contribute a large portion to each plan, again, amounts vary based on region. As an added benefit, Very provides 1X Earnings Basic Life & AD&D. We have a 401k program that we’ll provide a 2% match on after a few months working with us. Lastly, 35% of the company’s ownership is reserved for a team member options pool.

61,Software Developer_30373,Precision Nutrition,"Do you get excited about scaling, securing, and maintaining systems, so that our clients and our team have the tools they need, when they need them? Does troubleshooting, tinkering, and designing solutions to improve and monitor performance get you out of bed in the morning? Do you love to develop new features and build new products for a growing organization that makes a difference in people’s lives? Precision Nutrition is looking for an experienced developer who doesn’t just have a passion for building killer features, but also cares about maintaining and improving the overall health of our platform and infrastructure.
Who You Are
You balance the demands of product development, with the need to scale our growing user base. You can work anywhere in the stack: you mess with javascript for breakfast, write a new RESTful API endpoint in Rails for a mid-morning snack, tune a query in Postgres for lunch, and write an Ansible cookbook for dinner. You share our belief that every developer takes ownership of our production environment and isn’t above operations work.
We know this is a tall order and requires a special person to do it right. If this sounds intriguing to you, read on.
What You Get to Do
Ruby/Rails API development. Our coaching platform is backed by a RESTful API implemented in Rails. You’ll spend a lot of your time building, testing, and working with Rails. We’re using Elixir and Phoenix too, so come prepared to learn!
Ember. Our front-end devs are focused on working with our suite of Ember, user-facing applications - but it really helps if you can see the big picture and understand our stack front to back. That means learning Ember.js and Ember Data. Don’t worry - you’ll have lots of help. We’ve got a team of Ember experts to show you the ropes.
DevOps. You’ll write reliable, scripted means of deploying code and system changes (today we use Ansible, yet we’re open to trying new tools). You’ll maintain provisioning and continuous integration systems, keep system software up to date, and ensure code can be deployed and rolled back easily and reliably, while making sure backups are behaving, and security best practices are being followed.
Monitor performance.You’ll design and execute performance tests on our website and other applications, as well as recommend and implement system and application performance best practices.
Maintain our systems. You’ll monitor the health of all systems, participate in our on-call rotation team, and respond to, and escalate infrastructure issues. You’ll perform regular and ad hoc sysadmin tasks on all shared systems, and manage Amazon Web Services and other hosting service providers. You’ll schedule and manage site downtime, and work with the team to proactively add infrastructure so that our clients and team have the best experience possible.
Our Ideal Candidate
Is experienced. You have at least 5 years of experience in a Development or DevOps role in an Agile environment. You know, or are excited to learn, Ruby on Rails, Ember, and maybe even some Elixir/Phoenix, as well as the usual tools of the trade: Amazon Web Services such as EC2, S3 and RDS, Ansible, Vagrant, Linux, PostgreSQL, Continuous Integration, and Redis.
Is on the cutting edge. In your spare time, you research and stay up to date on the latest and greatest best practices, systems, and tools.
Likes variety. You'll be wrangling all kinds of systems, apps, and technologies - everything from our Wordpress-based sales sites to our modern Ember/Rails based coaching platform and our next generation Elixir based payment processing system.
Can easily switch gears. You have the ability to prioritize and re-prioritize your work in a changing environment - you understand that things change as new information is made available. You don’t mind managing multiple projects and have the ability to have a few balls up in the air at one time.
Cares. You take care of our data and systems like they are your very own.
Is self-motivated and can work independently. Once you are confident in what you need to do, you can run with it and don’t need a lot of direction. You are highly organized and always eager to learn more and share with the team.
Leaves their ego at the door. You have integrity, talent, are outgoing, have a palpable excitement about the future, and don’t show it off. Shadiness, mediocrity, cynicism, and excessive ""constructive criticism"" are out.
Is resilient and has a growth mindset. Part of open, honest communication is having the ability to deliver honest, direct feedback without being offensive or critical. The other part is having the ability to view honest, direct feedback as a gift you can use to get better. If you’re married to your ideas or are (even mildly) offended when they’re challenged, this probably won’t be a good fit for you.
Has worked remotely. You have strong self-structure and discipline and have worked remotely either currently or in the past so you know the benefits and the challenges.
Wants to be part of a purpose-driven organization. PN is a pretty incredible place and is committed to allowing you to do the work you love and love the work you do.
Life-changing, research-driven nutrition coaching. That's our mission at Precision Nutrition.
As an organization, we:

Seek and support diversity.
Offer 4 weeks paid time-off, benefits, and the ability to work remotely.
Set you up with whatever fancy gear you need to perform at your best.
Give you the flexibility to make your own schedule.

Not only that, but if you join us you can:
Work in the fitness and nutrition industry.  We love exercise, we love nutrition, and we love sport. That’s why we started this company. If you do too, you’ll appreciate how rare it is to find a career you really love. For active, fit people, Precision Nutrition is that opportunity.
Work with fun, bright, and talented people. We’re a small company, and we’re picky about who we work with, because to us, this isn’t just a job; it’s our life.

62,Software Engineer_30318,American Poolplayers Association,"About Us:
As the World’s Largest Pool League, American Poolplayers Association (APA) has a unique business model that brings the people who are passionate about pool together with those who want to be social and have fun into a perfect mix of sports-themed entertainment. Only under our exceptional system can people from all backgrounds and skill levels, from total beginner to semi-professional, compete in the game of pool and have fun.
Our offices are located in Lake Saint Louis, MO, right on the lake. We have a very relaxed atmosphere to work in and we believe in a healthy work/life balance. APA is a family owned and operated business and the sense of family is very strong given that the average tenure of our employees is 10+ years.
About the Position:
While the APA has used technology for decades, our in-house development team is just a couple of years old and we’re growing it slowly and methodically to ensure proper fit of everyone we ask to join our team. We have a mix of legacy(VB.Net/SOAP) and modern(C#/WebAPI, React/GraphQL/Meteor/Node.js) applications that need support and enhancement as well as a backlog of new applications that need to be built.
We are looking for full-stack or front-end developers who want to build modern, web based, mobile friendly apps that will enhance our customer experience and bring a modern and tech-savvy edge to the pool league industry. We are pushing the envelope for what our industry has seen in regard to customer experience and service. This position is for someone more skilled in Javascript (Node/Angular/React/Meteor) than .Net languages. Our tech team gets to choose the stack so open source languages such Ruby, Go, Erlang are a possibility for the right task.
The technologies we use:


Node.js, React, Meteor, GraphQL(Apollo) ← This is what we're hiring for

ASP VB.Net (legacy apps being supported while we retire them)
VB.Net Soap Services (legacy SOA tier being supported while we retire them)
C# WebAPI using EF, StructureMap (New Restful API)
SQL Server, Redis and Memcached (Data storage and caching)
Anything new that looks cool, sexy and can solve a need

Examples of existing projects and opportunities include:

Data-rich/responsive website for our customers with stats, schedules, standings, player profiles and social-media driven content
Opportunities to learn and use platforms like React/Node.js, Cordova/PhoneGap and XCode/Swift to develop and deliver mobile apps
Custom solutions for our International Tournaments held in Las Vegas (The World’s Largest according to Guinness World Records)
Electronic scoring and payment systems to take full advantage of the mobile-revolution
Work together with our back-end team to help add value to the support of our existing projects and make them shine

Key Responsibilities:

Have fun and work hard
Work closely with in-house team of Creative and Operational leaders to craft solutions and bring amazing ideas to fruition
Solve problems and deliver solutions with speed and grace
Be a team player and work on whatever project needs you (We are a small team where egos are not tolerated)

About You:
You've been a software developer for a handful of years but what's really important to us is what you've learned and what you've done. You are aware of what you know and don't know, but that doesn't stop you from tackling the hard problems with great enthusiasm, actually the more impossible the task, the more determined you are to find a solution. However, you understand when to call for help, when to ditch an idea and pivot to something different. You know when to push back on a requirement and ask for more clarity. You stay current on tech. You love what you do and are passionate about creating great software (or at least you dream of being on a team that wants you to do so). You may have a Comp Sci degree, but you may just have stumbled into software development and found that you had a knack for it. You know your craft and you may have even squealed a little inside when the word ""craft"" was used to describe software development. You have worked on an Agile Development team before and understand Sprints, User Stories, and Story Point estimation. If not, you just googled ""Agile Development"" to learn more because that's just who you are. 
You have experience with some of the following (listed in order of importance):

Building applications with React or a similar Javascript framework
Bootstrap, HTML5, CSS3 and LESS, SASS, JCSS, etc.
Responsive web development experience - CSS media queries and JavaScript device detection
Production application experience with Cordova (we currently use Meteor and it's Cordova integration) and/or Electron
Working knowledge of Version Control such as Git or Mercurial
Experience with VB.Net, C#, MVC and/or ASP.Net (our API is C# WebAPI and legacy apps are in VB.Net)
Knowledgeable in Google Analytics/Google Tag Manager/Google Webmaster Tools a plus
Knowledgeable in WordPress/PHP a plus

Perks of working for APA:

You get your choice of computing hardware (Mac, PC, Laptop or Desktop, the choice is yours) and two or three massive 27"" monitors to go with it
We close our offices between Christmas and New Years
401k with a healthy company match (after 1 year)
Competitive health insurance options (after 90 days)

TradeTapp is an early stage startup whose focus is on using technology and financial analysis to help the construction management industry make better decisions.  Our product is a SaaS platform that assists general contractors in collecting, analyzing, and vetting the companies they hire to do the actual building.  We were founded in early 2016 by a construction industry expert along with two software developers.  Since launching, TradeTapp has already been adopted by some of the leading construction firms in the country, and is showing opportunity for significant future growth.

65,Sr. Software Engineer Full Stack_30344,Very,"Interviewing for a new company is a serious time commitment for all parties involved. Please take the time to read this and thoughtfully consider if we would be a good fit for one another. This is a full-time position. You must be located in the continental U.S. No contractors or agencies. Seriously.
Why We Started Very
Not to oversimplify things, but our mission is to become the best IoT, blockchain, and machine learning product development shop in the world. We do this by hiring the best and investing heavily in them, both personally and professionally.
We Fully Embrace Working Remotely
About 30% of our team works out of our HQ in Chattanooga, TN, and the other 70% work remotely from various locations across the United States. We consider ourselves best-practitioners of the remote-first movement and believe a great team shouldn’t be restricted by geography.
What You’ll Be Working On
Very is first and foremost a software consultancy, we tackle hard problems for clients who need a targeted, senior team to come in and provide specific solutions. We are focusing heavily on building out products that have applications in one of the three following areas: 1) data science & machine learning, 2) Internet of Things, and 3) blockchain. We’ve found that in each of these areas, the use of the underlying technology will drive the development of the core services , but that 75% of the work often still lives in the realm of modern web development.
At Very, there is a never ending supply of variety to the types of projects we work on. In the last year we’ve built solutions that touch e-commerce, trust management (finance), beer distribution, point of sale systems, ICO’s, identifying fake news, and much more.
You’ll spend 80% of your week (Monday through Thursday) designing and building a product or platform for one of our clients. The other 20% of your week (Friday) will be spent contributing to our open source projects, internal products, learning, teaching, and participating in internal operations of all flavors.
Project teams are small and usually made up of one or two pairs of engineers, a UX engineer, a product manager, and the client who serves as the product owner. We spend most of our time building new products, with the goal of helping our clients take it to market. We are often further engaged by our clients to continue iterating on the product once it is live. The high cost of context switching is real, so we do our best to keep teams together throughout the duration of their projects (typically 3-6 months), but have found it valuable to rotate pairing partners when it makes reasonable sense.
We are always exploring new tools, languages, and technologies. We feel strongly that it’s a good idea to use the best tool for the job and not see everything as a nail. We also try our best to standardize our technology and tooling across project teams so it’s easier to rotate and practice collective code ownership. We are currently building products and platforms using the following tools / platforms:


React & React Native


Swift & Objective C


Elixir, Phoenix, and Nerves


Arduino (embedded C/C++)


Ethereum / Solidity


Ruby on Rails


Python


Pandas


Serverless


AWS (and a dash of Heroku where it makes sense)


Given that we work on quite a bit of greenfield projects, there is often room to experiment with new patterns and tools (within reason). We don’t expect applicants to know our entire toolchain, but rather to be capable, flexible, and self-directed.
This Role: Senior Full-Stack Software Engineer
As a full-stack engineer at Very, you will work on a wide variety of projects and stacks. This job is a great fit for pragmatic polyglot programmers with a functional bend. Over the last few years, we’ve shipped countless Ruby on Rails projects and are at the tail end of moving to Elixir for the bulk of our services. Additionally, we have a strong Python contingent who are utilizing the serverless framework for the development of highly targeted microservices / systems as well as for data science and machine learning projects.
We value well-tested, reusable code and expect our engineers to be as good of practitioners as they are leaders and teachers.
How We Operate
We are believers in transparency and openness. In terms of organizational structure and governance, we are a holacracy. It’s worked pretty well for the us the last few years. When it comes to development processes, we do our best to adhere as closely to Extreme Programming as possible. We believe in hiring capable, responsible professionals. We don’t micromanage and trust everyone to work hard, experiment, learn from their mistakes, and contribute to each other and the company in a sustainable manner. We have no venture funding or external investors, which affords us the ability to be nimble and run our company in the best interest of our team as a whole.
How You’ll Be Compensated
We believe in a transparent, fair compensation structure and have developed our own open salary formula. Depending on your skill and experience, you can expect to make somewhere between $80,000 and $135,000 upon joining the company. We have many health plans available through UHC—prices and plans vary based on your region—as well as vision and dental. We currently contribute a large portion to each plan, again, amounts vary based on region. As an added benefit, Very provides 1X Earnings Basic Life & AD&D. We have a 401k program that we’ll provide a 2% match on after a few months working with us.

3,Backend Developer_30416,Cornershop Creative,"Cornershop Creative (https://cornershopcreative.com) is seeking an awesome, U.S.-based backend developer to join our distributed team. This will be a short-term, full-time 4-6 month engagement to help with specific projects. (We hope this will turn into a permanent full-time position, but we canÃ¢ÂÂt guarantee that at the moment.)
ÃÂ 
The core responsibility for this position will be building custom API integrations and scripting data migrations for WordPress-based websites and applications for our non-profit and small business clients. Tasks may include setting up WordPress custom post types, fields and taxonomies; troubleshooting server errors and migrating sites to different hosts; integrating WordPress data with third-party tools like SalesForce and Blackbaud products; and creating scripts to migrate data from other CMSes and data structures to WordPress. Additionally, this position may be responsible for developing and maintaining custom WordPress plugins.
ÃÂ 
While our primary need is strong PHP skills with solid experience building sites and applications in WordPress, our ideal candidate will have familiarity and eagerness to learn to code in other languages and on other frameworks (e.g. javascript, mobile app development, Laravel).
ÃÂ 
Our ideal candidate is a hard-working, curious troubleshooter comfortable working independently with little supervision who also enjoys working as part of a team that includes developers and non-developers. Since we're a distributed shop, youÃ¢ÂÂll get to work from home! Cool, right?
ÃÂ 
Some Things YouÃ¢ÂÂll Need to be Comfortable With:


Making WordPress sync data with common (and not so common) third-party REST & SOAP APIs


Crafting ingenious scripts to migrate datasets from outside systems, such as other CMSes, into WordPress, even when their character encoding isnÃ¢ÂÂt what you want it to be


WordPress theming, including the template hierarchy, hooks, WP_Query, etc.


Finding existing libraries, plugins or other internal/external solutions to solve programming challenges, rather than reinventing the wheel


Deploying websites onto production hosts via git, rsync (and maybe sometimes sFTP), configuring caching, updating DNS records, and associated launch tasks


Quickly and effectively maintaining/troubleshooting/supporting code written by other developers


Command line tools like git, gulp, and wp-cli


JavaScript (particularly in jQuery)


Laughing at our stupid jokes (and the occasional good one)


Performing basic devops/Linux sysadmin tasks like writing bash scripts, configuring web or database servers, and figuring out why the Ã¢ÂÂuploads donÃ¢ÂÂt work!Ã¢ÂÂ


Troubleshooting MySQL performance issues (and writing performant queries)


Working in a fast-paced environment (we keep pretty busy!) and managing a workload of several projects at a time


Utilizing superb written and oral communication skills


ÃÂ 
Other stuff weÃ¢ÂÂd love it if youÃ¢ÂÂre good at, but arenÃ¢ÂÂt requirements:


Working with and customizing Buddy/bbPress and WooCommerce


Drafting functional requirements that specify the appropriate technologies, techniques and architectures necessary to bring needed features to life


Working with other developers to implement the aforementioned plans


Not losing your s#!% when you occasionally get feedback like Ã¢ÂÂNevermind. We actually need that field that we told you not to migrateÃ¢ÂÂ (and then getting asked to change it back), which may happen despite our best efforts 


Working with nonprofit CRM tools such as Salsa, Luminate Online, Engaging Networks, and Salesforce


Remembering to un-mute yourself before talking on conference calls


Being passionate about progressive causes


Writing custom CSS/SASS for cross-browser, responsive design (not just by using Bootstrap)


Configuring and/or maintaining AWS environments for hosting PHP-based websites and applications


Mucking around with Laravel

8,Client Care Specialist_30374,Precision Nutrition,"Do you have the ability to read into a question and really understand what someone is asking? Does Ã¢ÂÂmaking someone's day' get you out of bed in the morning? Do you want to work with a company that really makes a difference in the lives of others?
We are looking for a rockstar Client Care Specialist to join our team and provide superior customer service that exceeds our client's expectations.
What You'll be Doing
You get to work from home with an amazing team of Client Care Specialists that care deeply about building and strengthening our client relationships. You will educate clients on our products and respond to tough (and not-so-tough) inquiries through email using Desk.com and on live chat using Intercom.io. You will also make the occasional phone call. Yep, you'll be responding to LOTS of people and putting smiles on their faces all day. That takes a certain kind of person. If that's you...read on.
Our Ideal Candidate
Knows their stuff. This can't be your first rodeo. You have at least 2 years of experience in a web-based, service oriented company providing customer support where email and live chat were your primary responsibilities.
Can read between the lines.ÃÂ Sometimes a client's question isn't always obvious, and I'm sure you know, a lot can get lost in 'email' translation. A client may be asking for one thing, and really need something else. You have an uncanny ability to read into what they are looking for, ask the right questions, and exceed their expectations by responding to their real question.
Has great sleuthing skills. You are able to do your own detective work and find clues with the tools you have access to. You never pass on a case without first trying to piece the puzzle together.
Is an exceptional communicator. You know how to get your message across clearly and concisely to different audiences, through the written word. You are a skilled writer and have outstanding proofreading skills. Yup, you're a natural here.
Embraces sales.ÃÂ You understand that part of your role is to be a frontline salesperson and you see this as an important part of how you approach your work.
Cares.ÃÂ You are an empathetic advocate for our clients. You recognize that through email, you are building relationships, making our customers feel cared for, and quickly solving problems if an experience doesn't go 100% as planned. You care about our clients having accurate information and are getting their issues resolved.
Is thorough and obsessed with the details. You are careful, cautious, and incredibly meticulous; some may even call you nitpicky - in an endearing way, of course! And, you dream about dotting the i's and crossing the t's. Nothing slips by the net when you're goalie.
Is comfortable with frequent pivots.ÃÂ You have the ability to prioritize and re-prioritize your work in a fast-changing environment - you understand that things change as new information is made available. You don't mind shifting gears and are skilled at having a few balls up in the air at one time.
Is committed to their craft.ÃÂ You were meant to be in Client Care. It is your unique ability. It's not a stepping stone to join PN or to gain some experience to launch another career. You care about people and want to be sure they have everything they need to make the right decision for themselves and get their questions answered.
Has the ability to work independently and can ramp up quickly, for more intense periods of work.ÃÂ Once you are confident in what you need to do, you can run with it and don't need a lot of direction. That said, you are not on an island. You'll get plenty of help and support from the team when you need it and when it gets busy during launch periods and the team needs you - you'll jump right in.
Leaves their ego at the door.ÃÂ You have integrity, talent, are outgoing, have a palpable excitement about the future, and don't show it off. Shadiness, mediocrity, cynicism, and excessive 'constructive criticism' are out.
Wants to be part of a purpose-driven organization.ÃÂ PN is a pretty incredible place and is committed to allowing you to do the work you love and love the work you do.
Life-changing, research-driven nutrition coaching. That's our mission at Precision Nutrition.
As an organization, we:

Seek and support diversity.
Offer 4 weeks paid time-off, benefits, and the ability to work remotely.
Set you up with whatever fancy gear you need to perform at your best.
Give you the flexibility to make your own schedule.

Not only that, but if you join us you can:

Work in the fitness and nutrition industry. We love exercise, we love nutrition, and we love sport. That's why we started this company. If you do too, you'll appreciate how rare it is to find a career you really love. For active, fit people, Precision Nutrition is that opportunity.
Work with fun, bright, and talented people. We're a small company, and we're picky about who we work with, because to us, this isn't just a job; it's our life.

If you or someone you know is interested in the position we welcome you to apply below. Please only apply if you are committed to the Client Care field. Only serious applicants will be considered and not those looking for an opportunity to get into PN.",https://d2fcz5no062gar.cloudfront.nethttps://authenticjobs.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/logos/c93a02aefdcef5c3d54be41d4bd142f4/thumb/square logo.png,https://www.precisionnutrition.com/careers,Authentic Jobs,"Other, Sales, Nutrition, Fitness, Industry","218,317,366,401,456,488,525,549,596,598,661,679,696,734,786,792,793,805,807,815,840,879,896,1003,1011,1019,1026,1057,1069,1114,1117,1149,1158,1175,1194,1200,1223,1237,1239,1243,1245,1250,1261,1303,1397,1422,1445,1469,1484,1522,1526,1529,1534,1538,1548,1556,1557,1572,1579,1585,1588,1606,1610,1637,1654,1677,1684,1700,1708,1727,1734,1737,1802,1813,1848,1855,1885,1908,1917,1933,1956,1957,1965,2000,2001,2013,2053,2140,2144,2151,2334,2358,2388,2428,2454,2455,2474,2510,2538,2560,2566,2579,2583,2606,2624,2626,2696,2723,2739","23,78,87,106,118",Anywhere in Canada,Full-time

Projects will be supplied on a contract basis with a clear scope of work that leaves no question regarding expectations for each party involved.

WeÃ¢ÂÂre a small bunch so far but we have plans for world domination. WeÃ¢ÂÂre based in Long Beach, just a Kobe 3-pointer from the beach, and a taxi ride from the heart of LA. We are on the lookout for an individual who seeks a position at the cutting edge of web development. All candidates must work with speed and enjoy sweating over tight deadlines. They must live to code and not be happy until theyÃ¢ÂÂve seen a project through from insemination to birth to that first day at kindergarten.
Who are you? The dude (or dudette) for the role should have a minimum of two years in the world of web development, with a portfolio thatÃ¢ÂÂs likely to blow our socks off.
Because we live in the virtual world, it does not matter where you reside, as long as you are available during business hours. Still reading?
Can you tick these boxes?
ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ You are a Wordpress Whiz and have extensive knowledge/experience with front-end work.
ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ YouÃ¢ÂÂre a dab hand in JavaScript/jQuery (If you can write plugins as well then thatÃ¢ÂÂs a bonus, but you must be able to write and implement small-to-medium scripts at least)
ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ YouÃ¢ÂÂre an old pro in writing raw HTML and CSS (especially HTML5 and CSS3)
ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ You are experienced working with PHP tasks
ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ YouÃ¢ÂÂre used to developing in a LAMP environment

ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ YouÃ¢ÂÂre a web developer with two or more years of professional industry experience
And it goes without saying You can both talk the talk and walk the walk. You have 20:20 vision when it comes to fine details. You consider missing a deadline one of the seven deadly sins.

Common Networks was founded on the idea that everyone should have a choice for fast, affordabe access to broadband internet. Right now, most homes in the U.S. don't, in fact 62% of homes live in a monopoly broadband market. High-speed access unlocks all the superpowers on the internet. When it works, it can be a great leveling force across the world, giving everyone access to educational tools, entertainment, immediate translations, or even medical care that they wouldn't otherwise have.
Common Networks provides surburban neighborhoods with internet using wireless technology. We interconnect homes in a neighborhood, creating a mesh network between homes and our fiber internet sources. A whole community can then have fast and reliable internet service with only a fewÃÂ  locations needing fiber access.

As the first designer, you will have heavy influence over our overall brand and product experience. We are seeking a designer who can use design thinking, product design, and visual design to help achieve our company-level goals.

Build designs for products and features for a number of different audiences: internal users, field technicians, and our internet subscribers

Collaborative team member.ÃÂ  You are open, honest, and can respectfully work through difficult problems with the rest of the team.
Clear communicator. You have many audiences - engineers, designers, operations team, our board of directores, etc. You know how to structure written and verbal communications clearly for each audience.

41,Product Designers at multiple levels_30321,WeTransfer,"Every day, millions of people rely on WeTransfer to share their creative ideas. So, the work we do matters. Come and be a part of it.
Our approach to design
WeTransfer aims to build simple tools around peopleÃ¢ÂÂs creative process, on any device. WeÃ¢ÂÂre interested in the weird and wonderful ways that creative minds work, and how they shape the world around us. This thinking has made our products and brand loved by anyone Ã¢ÂÂ from our moms to your favorite artists. As we grow, the simplicity of our service will be challenged. It is our responsibility to design and deliver delightful experiences that continue to feel obvious and intuitive to millions of people every day.
What youÃ¢ÂÂll be doing
As a product designer, you will work side-by-side with engineers and a product manager in a product team. Teams work autonomously, owning their part of the experience. YouÃ¢ÂÂll be responsible for the design of that experience and act as a creative and strategic partner for your teammates. This work is supported by a range of specialists to make sure design decisions are well-informed and that you have everything needed to take WeTransfer to the next level.
Product design at WeTransfer spans from subtle tweaks that make a difference, to innovation projects that define our productsÃ¢ÂÂ future. YouÃ¢ÂÂll work to improve, expand on and push the WeTransfer experience forward; designing elegant flows and interactions, testing solutions with prototypes, iterating to reach product objectives, maintaining our design system Ã¢ÂÂ all across web, mobile and desktop applications, and through product integrations. Every week youÃ¢ÂÂll get together with a group of designers to present and review work.
We take pride in building tools that enable creativity to flow. This has shaped the experience weÃ¢ÂÂve built, the way we work, and how we view our organization. Through our monthly Innovation Fridays, anyone in the company can work together to explore that outlook and whatÃ¢ÂÂs next for WeTransfer.
Qualities weÃ¢ÂÂll be looking for

We value smarts and an inquisitive attitude. YouÃ¢ÂÂll deal with quite a bit of complexity, and should be comfortable with ambiguity and abstraction.
WeTransfer is part of the creative community and so are you Ã¢ÂÂ broadly interested in tech, culture, and the arts.
You love to learn, unlearn, and relearn. In this rapidly changing world, itÃ¢ÂÂs imperative to keep evolving. You are an experienced designer, with a relevant education and some (or many) years on the ground.
You demonstrate a product mindset. Shipping product is key, that means youÃ¢ÂÂre happy to experiment and prototype, eager to talk to users, quick to sketch out ideas and you know how to get your design through development.
You articulate your ideas effectively through your verbal and written communication skills. Proficiency in the English language is required.
Our products are used by all kinds of amazing people, from all over the world. We actively look to have this diversity reflected in our teams.
Our product teams work from our Amsterdam office. You should either live within a commutable distance, or willing to relocate (we'll help you make the move, some conditions apply for visa applications).
We are growing rapidly and looking to fill several positions at multiple levels. WeÃ¢ÂÂd love for you to get in touch if youÃ¢ÂÂre ready for the next step in your career, working with an amazing team to create meaningful products for millions of people every day. ÃÂ°ÃÂÃÂÃÂ

Atlantic Media Values:Across Atlantic Media, generally, the firm looks for two Ã¢ÂÂpillar giftsÃ¢ÂÂ in you, and everyone else. ÃÂ In all of us, these are more aspirational than actual, but they are central in our intentions Ã¢ÂÂ
Force of Ideas:ÃÂ  At the center of Atlantic Media work are the ideas within our writing.ÃÂ  We believe that ideas Ã¢ÂÂ to the good and not Ã¢ÂÂ have consequence.ÃÂ  Our highest work is bringing rigor, insight, intellectual honesty, to that ultimate purpose of separating the bad from the good, and giving voice to the latter.Spirit of Generosity:ÃÂ ÃÂ Atlantic Media seeks in its ranks a spirit of generosity Ã¢ÂÂ a natural disposition in each colleague toward service and selfless conduct.ÃÂ  Atlantic Media writing should be cut from the same cloth Ã¢ÂÂcritical on the merits but informed by charity and forbearance in measuring motive and personal character.

61,Senior Software Engineer JavaScript_30343,Very,"Interviewing for a new company is a serious time commitment for all parties involved. Please take the time to read this and thoughtfully consider if we would be a good fit for one another. This is a full-time position. You must be located in the continental U.S. No contractors or agencies. Seriously.
Why We Started Very
Not to oversimplify things, but our mission is to become the best IoT, blockchain, and machine learning product development shop in the world. We do this by hiring the best and investing heavily in them, both personally and professionally.
We Fully Embrace Working Remotely
About 30% of our team works out of our HQ in Chattanooga, TN, and the other 70% work remotely from various locations across the United States. We consider ourselves best-practitioners of the remote-first movement and believe a great team shouldnÃ¢ÂÂt be restricted by geography.
What YouÃ¢ÂÂll Be Working On
Very is first and foremost a software consultancy, we tackle hard problems for clients who need a targeted, senior team to come in and provide specific solutions. We are focusing heavily on building out products that have applications in one of the three following areas: 1) data science & machine learning, 2) Internet of Things, and 3) blockchain. WeÃ¢ÂÂve found that in each of these areas, the use of the underlying technology will drive the development of the core services , but that 75% of the work often still lives in the realm of modern web development.
At Very, there is a never ending supply of variety to the types of projects we work on. In the last year weÃ¢ÂÂve built solutions that touch e-commerce, trust management (finance), beer distribution, point of sale systems, ICOÃ¢ÂÂs, identifying fake news, and much more.
YouÃ¢ÂÂll spend 80% of your week (Monday through Thursday) designing and building a product or platform for one of our clients. The other 20% of your week (Friday) will be spent contributing to our open source projects, internal products, learning, teaching, and participating in internal operations of all flavors.
Project teams are small and usually made up of one or two pairs of engineers, a UX engineer, a product manager, and the client who serves as the product owner. We spend most of our time building new products, with the goal of helping our clients take it to market. We are often further engaged by our clients to continue iterating on the product once it is live. The high cost of context switching is real, so we do our best to keep teams together throughout the duration of their projects (typically 3-6 months), but have found it valuable to rotate pairing partners when it makes reasonable sense.
We are always exploring new tools, languages, and technologies. We feel strongly that itÃ¢ÂÂs a good idea to use the best tool for the job and not see everything as a nail. We also try our best to standardize our technology and tooling across project teams so itÃ¢ÂÂs easier to rotate and practice collective code ownership. We are currently building products and platforms using the following tools / platforms:


React & React Native


Swift & Objective C


Elixir, Phoenix, and Nerves


Arduino (embedded C/C++)


Ethereum / Solidity


Ruby on Rails


Python


Pandas


Serverless


AWS (and a dash of Heroku where it makes sense)


Given that we work on quite a bit of greenfield projects, there is often room to experiment with new patterns and tools (within reason). We donÃ¢ÂÂt expect applicants to know our entire toolchain, but rather to be capable, flexible, and self-directed.
This Role: Senior Software Engineer // Javascript
Over the past few years, weÃ¢ÂÂve seen client-side engineering emerge as its own discipline, and we are looking for individuals who thrive in the front end and want to further their practice. Ideal candidates not only have a solid engineering background, but a passion for client-side development as well.
We value well-tested, reusable code and expect our engineers to be as good of practitioners as they are leaders and teachers.
How We Operate
We are believers in transparency and openness. In terms of organizational structure and governance, we are a holacracy. ItÃ¢ÂÂs worked pretty well for the us the last few years. When it comes to development processes, we do our best to adhere as closely to Extreme Programming as possible. We believe in hiring capable, responsible professionals. We donÃ¢ÂÂt micromanage and trust everyone to work hard, experiment, learn from their mistakes, and contribute to each other and the company in a sustainable manner. We have no venture funding or external investors, which affords us the ability to be nimble and run our company in the best interest of our team as a whole.
How YouÃ¢ÂÂll Be Compensated
We believe in a transparent, fair compensation structure and have developed our own open salary formula. Depending on your skill and experience, you can expect to make somewhere between $80,000 and $135,000 upon joining the company. We have many health plans available through UHCÃ¢ÂÂprices and plans vary based on your regionÃ¢ÂÂas well as vision and dental. We currently contribute a large portion to each plan, again, amounts vary based on region. As an added benefit, Very provides 1X Earnings Basic Life & AD&D. We have a 401k program that weÃ¢ÂÂll provide a 2% match on after a few months working with us. Lastly, 35% of the companyÃ¢ÂÂs ownership is reserved for a team member options pool.

67,Software Developer_30373,Precision Nutrition,"Do you get excited about scaling, securing, and maintaining systems, so that our clients and our team have the tools they need, when they need them? Does troubleshooting, tinkering, and designing solutions to improve and monitor performance get you out of bed in the morning? Do you love to develop new features and build new products for a growing organization that makes a difference in peopleÃ¢ÂÂs lives? Precision Nutrition is looking for an experienced developer who doesnÃ¢ÂÂt just have a passion for building killer features, but also cares about maintaining and improving the overall health of our platform and infrastructure.
Who You Are
You balance the demands of product development, with the need to scale our growing user base. You can work anywhere in the stack: you mess with javascript for breakfast, write a new RESTful API endpoint in Rails for a mid-morning snack, tune a query in Postgres for lunch, and write an Ansible cookbook for dinner. You share our belief that every developer takes ownership of our production environment and isnÃ¢ÂÂt above operations work.
We know this is a tall order and requires a special person to do it right. If this sounds intriguing to you, read on.
What You Get to Do
Ruby/Rails API development. Our coaching platform is backed by a RESTful API implemented in Rails. YouÃ¢ÂÂll spend a lot of your time building, testing, and working with Rails. WeÃ¢ÂÂre using Elixir and Phoenix too, so come prepared to learn!
Ember. Our front-end devs are focused on working with our suite of Ember, user-facing applications - but it really helps if you can see the big picture and understand our stack front to back. That means learning Ember.js and Ember Data. DonÃ¢ÂÂt worry - youÃ¢ÂÂll have lots of help. WeÃ¢ÂÂve got a team of Ember experts to show you the ropes.
DevOps. YouÃ¢ÂÂll write reliable, scripted means of deploying code and system changes (today we use Ansible, yet weÃ¢ÂÂre open to trying new tools). YouÃ¢ÂÂll maintain provisioning and continuous integration systems, keep system software up to date, and ensure code can be deployed and rolled back easily and reliably, while making sure backups are behaving, and security best practices are being followed.
Monitor performance.YouÃ¢ÂÂll design and execute performance tests on our website and other applications, as well as recommend and implement system and application performance best practices.
Maintain our systems. YouÃ¢ÂÂll monitor the health of all systems, participate in our on-call rotation team, and respond to, and escalate infrastructure issues. YouÃ¢ÂÂll perform regular and ad hoc sysadmin tasks on all shared systems, and manage Amazon Web Services and other hosting service providers. YouÃ¢ÂÂll schedule and manage site downtime, and work with the team to proactively add infrastructure so that our clients and team have the best experience possible.
Our Ideal Candidate
Is experienced. You have at least 5 years of experience in a Development or DevOps role in an Agile environment. You know, or are excited to learn, Ruby on Rails, Ember, and maybe even some Elixir/Phoenix, as well as the usual tools of the trade: Amazon Web Services such as EC2, S3 and RDS, Ansible, Vagrant, Linux, PostgreSQL, Continuous Integration, and Redis.
Is on the cutting edge. In your spare time, you research and stay up to date on the latest and greatest best practices, systems, and tools.
Likes variety. You'll be wrangling all kinds of systems, apps, and technologies - everything from our Wordpress-based sales sites to our modern Ember/Rails based coaching platform and our next generation Elixir based payment processing system.
Can easily switch gears. You have the ability to prioritize and re-prioritize your work in a changing environment - you understand that things change as new information is made available. You donÃ¢ÂÂt mind managing multiple projects and have the ability to have a few balls up in the air at one time.
Cares. You take care of our data and systems like they are your very own.
Is self-motivated and can work independently. Once you are confident in what you need to do, you can run with it and donÃ¢ÂÂt need a lot of direction. You are highly organized and always eager to learn more and share with the team.
Leaves their ego at the door. You have integrity, talent, are outgoing, have a palpable excitement about the future, and donÃ¢ÂÂt show it off. Shadiness, mediocrity, cynicism, and excessive ""constructive criticism"" are out.
Is resilient and has a growth mindset. Part of open, honest communication is having the ability to deliver honest, direct feedback without being offensive or critical. The other part is having the ability to view honest, direct feedback as a gift you can use to get better. If youÃ¢ÂÂre married to your ideas or are (even mildly) offended when theyÃ¢ÂÂre challenged, this probably wonÃ¢ÂÂt be a good fit for you.
Has worked remotely. You have strong self-structure and discipline and have worked remotely either currently or in the past so you know the benefits and the challenges.
Wants to be part of a purpose-driven organization.ÃÂ PN is a pretty incredible place and is committed to allowing you to do the work you love and love the work you do.
Life-changing, research-driven nutrition coaching. That's our mission at Precision Nutrition.
As an organization, we:

Seek and support diversity.
Offer 4 weeks paid time-off, benefits, and the ability to work remotely.
Set you up with whatever fancy gear you need to perform at your best.
Give you the flexibility to make your own schedule.

Not only that, but if you join us you can:
Work in the fitness and nutrition industry.  We love exercise, we love nutrition, and we love sport. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs why we started this company. If you do too, youÃ¢ÂÂll appreciate how rare it is to find a career you really love. For active, fit people, Precision Nutrition is that opportunity.
Work with fun, bright, and talented people. WeÃ¢ÂÂre a small company, and weÃ¢ÂÂre picky about who we work with, because to us, this isnÃ¢ÂÂt just a job; itÃ¢ÂÂs our life.

68,Software Engineer_30318,American Poolplayers Association,"About Us:
As the WorldÃ¢ÂÂs Largest Pool League, American Poolplayers Association (APA) has a unique business model that brings the people who are passionate about pool together with those who want to be social and have fun into a perfect mix of sports-themed entertainment. Only under our exceptional system can people from all backgrounds and skill levels, from total beginner to semi-professional, compete in the game of pool and have fun.
Our officesÃÂ are located in Lake Saint Louis, MO, right on the lake. We have a very relaxed atmosphere to work inÃÂ and weÃÂ believe in a healthy work/life balance. APA is a family owned and operated business and the sense of family is very strong given that the average tenure of our employees is 10+ years.
About the Position:
While the APA hasÃÂ used technology for decades, our in-house development team is just a couple of years old and weÃ¢ÂÂre growing it slowly and methodically to ensure proper fit of everyone we ask to join our team. We have a mix of legacy(VB.Net/SOAP) and modern(C#/WebAPI, React/GraphQL/Meteor/Node.js) applications that need support and enhancement as well as a backlog of new applications that need to be built.
We are looking for full-stack or front-end developers who want to build modern, web based, mobile friendly apps that will enhance our customer experience and bring a modern and tech-savvy edge to the pool league industry. We are pushing the envelope for what our industry has seen in regard to customer experience and service. This position is for someone more skilled in Javascript (Node/Angular/React/Meteor) than .Net languages. Our tech teamÃÂ gets to choose theÃÂ stack soÃÂ open source languages such Ruby, Go, Erlang are a possibility for the right task.
The technologies we use:


Node.js, React, Meteor, GraphQL(Apollo)ÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ This is what we're hiring for

ASP VB.Net (legacy apps being supported while we retire them)
VB.Net Soap Services (legacy SOA tier being supported while we retire them)
C# WebAPI using EF, StructureMap (New Restful API)
SQL Server, Redis and Memcached (Data storage and caching)
Anything new that looks cool, sexy and can solve a need

Examples of existing projects and opportunities include:

Data-rich/responsive website for our customers with stats, schedules, standings, player profiles and social-media driven content
Opportunities to learn and use platforms like React/Node.js, Cordova/PhoneGap and XCode/Swift to develop and deliver mobile apps
Custom solutions for our International Tournaments held in Las Vegas (The WorldÃ¢ÂÂs Largest according to Guinness World Records)
Electronic scoring and payment systems to take full advantage of the mobile-revolution
Work together with our back-end team to help add value to the support of our existing projects and make them shine

Key Responsibilities:

Have fun and work hard
Work closely with in-house team of Creative and Operational leaders to craft solutions and bring amazing ideas to fruition
Solve problems and deliver solutions with speed and grace
Be a team player and work on whatever project needs you (We are a small team where egos are not tolerated)

About You:
You've been a software developer for a handful of years but what's really important to us is what you've learned and what you've done. You are aware of what you know and don't know, but that doesn't stop you from tackling the hard problems with great enthusiasm, actually the more impossible the task, the more determined you are to find a solution. However, you understand when to call for help, when to ditch an idea and pivot to something different. You know when to push back on a requirement and ask for more clarity. You stay current on tech. You love what you do and are passionate about creating great software (or at least you dream of being on a team that wants you to do so). You may have a Comp Sci degree, but you may just have stumbled into software development and found that you had a knack for it. You know your craft and you may have even squealed a little inside when the word ""craft"" was used to describe software development. You have worked on an Agile Development team before and understand Sprints, User Stories, and Story Point estimation. If not, you just googled ""Agile Development"" to learn more because that's just who you are.ÃÂ 
You have experience with some of the following (listed in order of importance):

Building applications with React or a similar Javascript framework
Bootstrap, HTML5, CSS3 and LESS, SASS, JCSS, etc.
Responsive web development experience - CSS media queries and JavaScript device detection
Production application experience with Cordova (we currently use Meteor and it's Cordova integration) and/or Electron
Working knowledge of Version Control such as Git or Mercurial
Experience with VB.Net, C#, MVC and/or ASP.Net (our API is C# WebAPI and legacy apps are in VB.Net)
Knowledgeable in Google Analytics/Google Tag Manager/Google Webmaster Tools a plus
Knowledgeable in WordPress/PHP a plus

Perks of working for APA:

You get your choice of computing hardware (Mac, PC, Laptop or Desktop, the choice is yours) and two or three massive 27"" monitors to go with it
We close our offices between Christmas and New Years
401k with a healthy company match (after 1 year)
Competitive health insurance options (after 90 days)

70,Solutions Architect_30421,meltmedia,"meltmedia is seeking a Solutions Architect to help us continue to deliver exceptional, web-based, technical solutions to our clients' problems. In addition to making our clients' lives easier through technology, you will also be highly involved in continuously improving the technical strategy of our various lines of business and helpÃÂ shape the overall technical strategy for the organization.
Your day in the life will be varied. You will work with our business development team to outline viable solutions for potential clients. You will work with established cross-discipline teams as they take your visions and make them their own, while ensuring the deliverables ultimately solve the clients' problems. You will also be expected to share your knowledge with your teammates, mentoring others through the challenges you have previously faced.
The right candidate will have extensive experience in the trenches, developing custom software solutions for clients. You will be an expert translator, from the clients' high level visions, into low-level technical details, and back. You are the type of person who has a strong desire to sit face-to-face with the client to understand their pain, while also needing to write some code from time-to-time. You understand there are often simple technical solutions to what may seem like unsurmountable problems to our clients. You thrive on making people's lives easier.
We are a cloud-first shop. You will have extensive knowledge in the full AWS stack. Ideally youÃ¢ÂÂve even jumped through the hoops of being officially certified as an AWS Solutions Architect. Our solutions vary based on the needs of our clients. We tend to develop custom solutions around our clients existing investments in products such as Adobe Experience Manager, Drupal 8, Veeva, Salesforce, and Pardot.ÃÂ  Any experience with these platforms would be highly beneficial.
Our custom solutions are a polyglot approach that may use Java, client and server-side JavaScript, Python, and PHP, depending on the needs of each project. We donÃ¢ÂÂt believe in having a client spend more money than necessary, therefore we prefer Ã¢ÂÂserverlessÃ¢ÂÂ solutions when appropriate.
As a Solutions Architect, there will be ample opportunity to introduce new and better technology, techniques, and solutions that grow our expertise and ultimately provideÃÂ better solutions for our clients.
Your prior experiences and the impact you personally had on the outcomes of those solutions, good and bad, will ultimately be the most important factor in determining if you are the right person for this role.
Along with a resumeÃÂ listing your relevant experience, please submit a cover letter explaining why youÃÂ are the perfect fit for what we seek.",https://d2fcz5no062gar.cloudfront.nethttps://authenticjobs.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/logos/7efe568ffbbe53b4e90877147233a184/thumb/2015 melt_logo.png,http://meltmedia.applytojob.com/apply/EogQH8ytrs/Solutions-Architect,Authentic Jobs,"Other, Media, Sales, Strategy, Salesforce","218,317,366,401,456,488,525,549,596,598,661,679,696,734,786,792,793,805,807,815,840,879,896,1003,1011,1019,1026,1057,1069,1114,1117,1149,1158,1175,1194,1200,1223,1237,1239,1243,1245,1250,1261,1303,1397,1422,1445,1469,1484,1522,1526,1529,1534,1538,1548,1556,1557,1572,1579,1585,1588,1606,1610,1637,1654,1677,1684,1700,1708,1727,1734,1737,1802,1813,1848,1855,1885,1908,1917,1933,1956,1957,1965,2000,2001,2013,2053,2140,2144,2151,2334,2358,2388,2428,2454,2455,2474,2510,2538,2560,2566,2579,2583,2606,2624,2626,2696,2723,2739","23,72,78,79,139","Tempe, AZ, US",Full-time

72,Sr. Software Engineer Full Stack_30344,Very,"Interviewing for a new company is a serious time commitment for all parties involved. Please take the time to read this and thoughtfully consider if we would be a good fit for one another. This is a full-time position. You must be located in the continental U.S. No contractors or agencies. Seriously.
Why We Started Very
Not to oversimplify things, but our mission is to become the best IoT, blockchain, and machine learning product development shop in the world. We do this by hiring the best and investing heavily in them, both personally and professionally.
We Fully Embrace Working Remotely
About 30% of our team works out of our HQ in Chattanooga, TN, and the other 70% work remotely from various locations across the United States. We consider ourselves best-practitioners of the remote-first movement and believe a great team shouldnÃ¢ÂÂt be restricted by geography.
What YouÃ¢ÂÂll Be Working On
Very is first and foremost a software consultancy, we tackle hard problems for clients who need a targeted, senior team to come in and provide specific solutions. We are focusing heavily on building out products that have applications in one of the three following areas: 1) data science & machine learning, 2) Internet of Things, and 3) blockchain. WeÃ¢ÂÂve found that in each of these areas, the use of the underlying technology will drive the development of the core services , but that 75% of the work often still lives in the realm of modern web development.
At Very, there is a never ending supply of variety to the types of projects we work on. In the last year weÃ¢ÂÂve built solutions that touch e-commerce, trust management (finance), beer distribution, point of sale systems, ICOÃ¢ÂÂs, identifying fake news, and much more.
YouÃ¢ÂÂll spend 80% of your week (Monday through Thursday) designing and building a product or platform for one of our clients. The other 20% of your week (Friday) will be spent contributing to our open source projects, internal products, learning, teaching, and participating in internal operations of all flavors.
Project teams are small and usually made up of one or two pairs of engineers, a UX engineer, a product manager, and the client who serves as the product owner. We spend most of our time building new products, with the goal of helping our clients take it to market. We are often further engaged by our clients to continue iterating on the product once it is live. The high cost of context switching is real, so we do our best to keep teams together throughout the duration of their projects (typically 3-6 months), but have found it valuable to rotate pairing partners when it makes reasonable sense.
We are always exploring new tools, languages, and technologies. We feel strongly that itÃ¢ÂÂs a good idea to use the best tool for the job and not see everything as a nail. We also try our best to standardize our technology and tooling across project teams so itÃ¢ÂÂs easier to rotate and practice collective code ownership. We are currently building products and platforms using the following tools / platforms:


React & React Native


Swift & Objective C


Elixir, Phoenix, and Nerves


Arduino (embedded C/C++)


Ethereum / Solidity


Ruby on Rails


Python


Pandas


Serverless


AWS (and a dash of Heroku where it makes sense)


Given that we work on quite a bit of greenfield projects, there is often room to experiment with new patterns and tools (within reason). We donÃ¢ÂÂt expect applicants to know our entire toolchain, but rather to be capable, flexible, and self-directed.
This Role: Senior Full-Stack Software Engineer
As a full-stack engineer at Very, you will work on a wide variety of projects and stacks. This job is a great fit for pragmatic polyglot programmers with a functional bend. Over the last few years, weÃ¢ÂÂve shipped countless Ruby on Rails projects and are at the tail end of moving to Elixir for the bulk of our services. Additionally, we have a strong Python contingent who are utilizing the serverless framework for the development of highly targeted microservices / systems as well as for data science and machine learning projects.
We value well-tested, reusable code and expect our engineers to be as good of practitioners as they are leaders and teachers.
How We Operate
We are believers in transparency and openness. In terms of organizational structure and governance, we are a holacracy. ItÃ¢ÂÂs worked pretty well for the us the last few years. When it comes to development processes, we do our best to adhere as closely to Extreme Programming as possible. We believe in hiring capable, responsible professionals. We donÃ¢ÂÂt micromanage and trust everyone to work hard, experiment, learn from their mistakes, and contribute to each other and the company in a sustainable manner. We have no venture funding or external investors, which affords us the ability to be nimble and run our company in the best interest of our team as a whole.
How YouÃ¢ÂÂll Be Compensated
We believe in a transparent, fair compensation structure and have developed our own open salary formula. Depending on your skill and experience, you can expect to make somewhere between $80,000 and $135,000 upon joining the company. We have many health plans available through UHCÃ¢ÂÂprices and plans vary based on your regionÃ¢ÂÂas well as vision and dental. We currently contribute a large portion to each plan, again, amounts vary based on region. As an added benefit, Very provides 1X Earnings Basic Life & AD&D. We have a 401k program that weÃ¢ÂÂll provide a 2% match on after a few months working with us. Lastly, 35% of the companyÃ¢ÂÂs ownership is reserved for a team member options pool.",https://d2fcz5no062gar.cloudfront.net/assets/images/defaults/company-blank.png,https://authenticjobs.com/apply/30344,Authentic Jobs,"Web Development, Other, Data & Analytics, Finance, Management, Operations, E-Commerce, Google","215,216,217,219,224,229,230,233,237,240,241,259,263,265,269,272,273,277,281,282,286,295,302,305,306,310,320,322,326,330,338,340,348,355,358,359,361,365,373,380,390,396,399,408,413,417,418,421,427,430,438,449,450,460,474,480,485,490,497,502,544,546,554,561,568,570,590,593,608,611,618,641,647,691,716,723,726,736,755,756,771,773,774,784,816,829,848,865,869,878,881,884,913,915,918,922,926,950,954,957,968,976,977,986,993,1036,1037,1050,1054,1058,1085,1086,1090,1098,1102,1103,1112,1119,1131,1138,1143,1146,1168,1170,1172,1174,1183,1202,1203,1206,1207,1227,1229,1235,1247,1263,1277,1283,1284,1295,1315,1319,1328,1362,1363,1367,1372,1379,1384,1388,1406,1409,1414,1418,1439,1441,1462,1491,1553,1560,1561,1581,1583,1594,1617,1630,1631,1634,1644,1648,1690,1693,1695,1697,1721,1725,1733,1746,1749,1771,1777,1798,1819,1825,1830,1834,1852,1859,1877,1881,1886,1889,1921,1928,1929,1937,1938,1939,1946,1954,1961,1969,1983,1987,1994,2026,2027,2029,2048,2051,2063,2064,2083,2094,2105,2108,2119,2132,2136,2137,2155,2157,2159,2170,2174,2175,2176,2183,2200,2204,2206,2209,2211,2234,2235,2238,2248,2255,2256,2264,2285,2299,2304,2312,2346,2349,2356,2366,2367,2386,2391,2399,2413,2415,2417,2449,2465,2470,2472,2488,2489,2512,2517,2522,2528,2530,2532,2545,2549,2553,2554,2582,2592,2617,2628,2629,2635,2641,2646,2658,2661,2663,2667,2690,2714,2715,2721,2726,2733,2734,2742,2746,2763","22,23,27,32,56,100,103,135","Remote or Chattanooga, TN",Full-time

That doesn't just take the combined efforts of user experience and visual designers but also the designers who build the interactions. UX Engineers bring designs to life and sweat every detail. They focus on adding animations and details to interfaces not to just delight users but to improve their understanding of what the UI is doing. At Maark we believe this role is extremely important to creating the best possible experience for our clients and their customers.
As a UX Engineer at Maark you will work as part of the design team and develop front-end interfaces for the web. This is primarily a development role and will work closely with the engineering team as well.

Devoted Health is a new health care company looking to improve the lives of seniors in America. We are guided by a deep belief that every senior should be treated like we would treat our own family members: with loving care and a profound commitment to their health and well-being.  With aging demographics and rising health costs, this is an industry and problem space that needs todayÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs best talent working on solutions with high integrity and a long term view. We will improve the lives of seniors by helping them navigate the health care system, by utilizing world-class technology and data to enable a simplified experience, by partnering with top providers for better health outcomes. We are building a stellar team to drive towards our starting point goal to launch a Medicare Advantage plan and clinical services in 2019.

Why Devoted:

Make a difference... a big difference. You will have the opportunity, in a unique and dynamic culture, to be a part of something incredibly meaningful. WeÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂre a disruptive startup with an inspiring mission. Learn and grow alongside our world-class team of health care, technology, and data leaders, dedicated to building a health plan and clinical services that care for everyone like they were our own mothers or fathers. Our team and board members have decades of experience in health care entrepreneurship, data, technology, services, and policy. With their support, we look forward to building a health plan and clinical services that will give seniors easy access to the high-quality care they deserve.

A bit more about this role:

Technology does amazing things in our daily lives, yet often is a source of pain and confusion within health care.  We want to empower Devoted to deliver a world-class member experience with simple, flexible technical systems.  If we need to delve into the murky underbelly of health care IT to do that, weÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂre up for the challenge.  

Our north star is not a specific technology, but rather the goal of continually increasing the leverage of every member of the team. WeÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂre currently building with Go, PostgreSQL, gRPC, GraphQL, React, TypeScript, Terraform, and AWS, and we think itÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs a pretty awesome stack.

We want engineer-owners with the judgment to simultaneously solve for short and long-term business value.  WeÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂre looking for folks who have worked in complex domains and systems, and come through it with some wisdom but most importantly humility.  We want people who are passionate about building great technology to solve problems for usersÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂour members, our colleagues, and ourselves.

Whether you have a health care background or not, we are excited to learn from and share knowledge with you.  Our engineering leadership team includes seasoned alumni of health care and technology organizations spanning the public and private sector.  Our co-founders deeply understand and care about good technology:  Todd Park co-founded Athenahealth, a multi-billion-dollar health care technology company, and served as CTO of the U.S.; Ed Park was Athenahealth's founding engineer and served as its CTO, COO, and President of Services.

Responsibilities will include:


Building product features across a range of technologies
Working with subject matter experts to understand and design solutions to improve our members lives
Working with other members of the technology team to improve our technology platform
Attributes to success:


Experience coupled with a willingness to learn new things
Comfort with uncertainty and a desire to be close to business problems
Desire to contribute individually, with the ability both to self-direct work and to collaborate with others on the technology team
Understanding of many technologies down to first principles, and a desire to add more to the list
Desired skills and experience:


5+ years working as an individual technical contributor
Experience with our specific stack components a bonus but not required
Bonus: Prior backgrounds in product management, UX or data science; we often ask folks to wear more than one hat

101,Software Developer (Functional Programming),Jane Street,"Software Developer 

Jane Street is a proprietary quantitative trading firm, focusing primarily on trading equities and equity derivatives. We use innovative technology, a scientific approach, and a deep understanding of markets to stay successful in our highly competitive field. We operate around the clock and around the globe, employing over 500 people in offices in New York, London and Hong Kong.

The markets in which we trade change rapidly, but our intellectual approach changes faster still. Every day, we have new problems to solve and new theories to test. Our entrepreneurial culture is driven by our talented team of traders and programmers. At Jane Street, we don't come to work wanting to leave. We come to work excited to test new theories, have thought-provoking discussions, and maybe sneak in a game of ping-pong or two. Keeping our culture casual and our employees happy is of paramount importance to us.

We are looking to hire great software developers with an interest in functional programming. OCaml, a statically typed functional programming language with similarities to Haskell, Scheme, Erlang, F# and SML, is our language of choice. We've got the largest team of OCaml developers in any industrial setting, and probably the world's largest OCaml codebase. We use OCaml for running our entire business, supporting everything from research to systems administration to trading systems. If you're interested in seeing how functional programming plays out in the real world, there's no better place.

The atmosphere is informal and intellectual. There is a focus on education, and people learn about software and trading, both through formal classes and on the job. The work is challenging, and you get to see the practical impact of your efforts in quick and dramatic terms. Jane Street is also small enough that people have the freedom to get involved in many different areas of the business. Compensation is highly competitive, and there's a lot of room for growth.

You can learn more about Jane Street and our technology from our main site, janestreet.com. You can also look at a a talk given at CMU about why Jane Street uses functional programming (http://ocaml.janestreet.com/?q=node/61), and our programming blog (http://ocaml.janestreet.com).

We also have extensive benefits, including:


90% book reimbursement for work-related books
90% tuition reimbursement for continuing education
Excellent, zero-premium medical and dental insurance
Free lunch delivered daily from a selection of restaurants
Catered breakfasts and fresh brewed Peet's coffee
An on-site, private gym in New York with towel service

We design games for everyone, no matter where they are or who they are, and we employ all sorts of people from all kinds of backgrounds to bring them to life. Truth is, we simply canÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂt expect diversity in our players and originality in our games without first nurturing it in our people. A great saga needs all sorts of heroes.

We're looking for an experienced engineer to join our team as Infrastructure Lead!

About you:
You have years of hard-won experience building and operating robust cloud-based web services infrastructure.
You instrument and monitor everything you possibly can.
You automate everything to keep from being woken up in the middle of the night.
You love collaborating to design and implement elegant systems, but you're also ready to roll up your sleeves and get the job done.

We treat infrastructure as code, provisioning everything with Terraform and Chef, and we're starting to use Docker.
We believe that Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment mitigates risk, and you should too.
We think of ""DevOps"" both as a kind of culture, and as a pattern for rapid change.
We value confidence, humility, engagement, inclusiveness, consensus, and mutual trust.

We don't need you to be an expert in any particular technology -- we expect you to have a variety of tools in your kit, and the thoughtfulness to weigh trade-offs and apply each one wisely.

We have a lot of interesting problems to solve as we continue to grow and scale out! As Infrastructure Lead, you'll help us design the future of the Orion Platform, and then enable your team to collaborate with others to build it.

Come join us on this adventure! (And send us a link to your public Github profile, if you have one!)

Because weÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂre in the middle of a complete replatforming, weÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂre supporting multiple legacy environments while a separate department (Software Engineering) builds the new one. Each time Software Engineering completes a component of the new platform, Production Engineering partners with them to ensure launch readiness and do the actual launch, and then takes over the maintenance and enhancement of that component. This role can be remote.

147,Experienced Mobile Engineer,Loco2,"Loco2's mission is to make booking trains anywhere in Europe as easy and affordable as possible, from epic international adventures to everyday local commutes. Our booking coverage is unrivalled and growing.

We're looking for an experienced mobile engineer to join our growing engineering team. You will help us deliver a world-class mobile experience through our hybrid iOS app, combining fully native views with our Single Page Application (see below).

At Loco2 we care deeply about building an inclusive, open and supportive work environment. We behave with respect for people and the planet and are seeking a diverse range of candidates that share these values.

About us

We're a small, passionate and cosmopolitan team, with a healthy remote-first culture and an office in London. Our success is built on trust, empathy and shared knowledge, with our users at the centre of what we do. We're proud to have an average rating of 9.3 out of 10 on Trustpilot after 22,000 reviews.

WeÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂve been selling tickets since 2012 (read our full story here), and weÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂre growing rapidly as the business matures. Our goal is to scale effectively whilst continuing to delight our users.

Tech stack and role description

Our current mobile applications are hybrid, mixing fully native views with numerous embedded web-views, presenting parts of our mobile website.

WeÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂre sticking with the hybrid approach (i.e. we donÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂt intend to ever have fully native apps) but are now transitioning our traditional multi-page web application to a React-powered single-page application. WeÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂre hiring separately for experienced front-end developers to accelerate this transition.

Once weÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂve transitioned to the SPA, lots of functionality/UX will be identical across our mobile website and applications, but there remain areas where weÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂll need to use native functionality. One of Loco2ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs main goals is to be useful to customers when they are travelling, and building an exceptional mobile UX that feels truly native is one of our biggest goals for 2018.

Whilst we donÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂt expect you to be a master of all of the following technologies, our current software stack consists of:


A hybrid iOS app written in Swift
A hybrid Android app written in Kotlin
A traditional multi-page web application written in Ruby on Rails, using CoffeeScript and SCSS
A Ruby library for communicating with train booking APIs
AWS hosted Docker infrastructure, with continuous delivery
About you

An ideal candidate:


Has 3+ years of professional mobile application development experience
Solid experience with native iOS development
Takes pride in their craft and adheres to industry best practices such as testing, code linting, peer review and clean modular maintainable code
Has a keen appetite for self-improvement and growth, but doesn't hesitate to ask for help when needed
Strives to discover and understand the root cause of problems, suggesting new and improved solutions, rather than treating the symptoms
Is fluent in English and confident communicating and sharing complex information and learnings with both technical and non-technical team members
Can work hours that have some overlap with London daytime
Is motivated by Loco2's mission

Onyx, our current wearable communicator, supports a great deal of complexity in a highly constrained embedding computing environment, with stringent product requirements for power consumption, audio quality, and user interface latency.

Our next generation of wearable products will require even more technical sophistication and elegance to support our ambitious goals for bringing push-to-talk voice to more people and more environments.

This is where you come in -- we're looking for an experienced engineer to join our team as Embedded Software Lead, and shepherd our forthcoming wearable communication products into reality.

About you:
You've shipped at least one embedded hardware product.
You have years of experience twiddling bits and puzzling over chipset datasheets.
You've had dreams in C++ or Java.
You have a deep understanding of operating system principles and know what not to do in an interrupt handler.
You have a thorough grasp of the Android SDK, and have built Android apps before.
You believe ardently in the value of unit and systems testing.
You know how to mentor and empower other engineers to succeed at their work.
You love collaborating to design and implement elegant systems, but you're also ready to roll up your sleeves and get the job done.
You've led an engineering team before, or you're a strong senior engineer ready to make the leap.
You understand and can voice the value of rigorous software engineering practices such as following coding conventions, clean pull requests and test driven development.
You are eager to learn.

About us:
Our current product is implemented on an ARM platform in C / C++, using the GCC toolchain.
We are building the next generation of devices that will power the future of voice communications.
We use GitHub extensively, rely on Agile process, and do Continuous Integration.
We value confidence, humility, engagement, inclusiveness, consensus, and mutual trust.

As Embedded Software Lead, you'll help us design the future of wearable push-to-talk communication, and then enable your team to collaborate with others to build it.

The role may involve some travel abroad, but the day-to-day work will be on-site with the team in our San Francisco office.

Come join us on this adventure! (And send us a link to your public Github profile, if you have one!)

Orion is dedicated to building a diverse and inclusive team with a wide range of backgrounds and experiences. This means striving to hire a diverse set of humans and providing them with support, mentorship, and opportunities to grow.

As a recognized leader in disciplined agile and lean software development practices, Pivotal combines the Silicon Valley state of mind, modern approach, and infrastructure with organizationsÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ core expertise and values. Our cloud-native platform and suite of data tools drive software innovation for many of the worldÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs most admired brands, helping enterprises move at start-up speeds and with greater business agility. We optimize for change and teach next-generation developers to create and build new solutions, and are committed to open source and open standards.

Our methodology is about evolving, in both development and innovation, and our culture is empowering. Our 2,000+ employees across offices worldwide subscribe to an ethos of kindness. We make a point to bring empathy to each and every project, and are guided by a purposeful missionÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂto transform how the world builds software.

You

You have a passion for developing large distributed systems to manage data. You understand that software that manages data at scale is a little different from other kinds of systems. Solutions that work fine on single nodes with gigabytes of data can fall over when scaled to petabytes of data and thousands of nodes. You relish discovering solutions that perform at scale while preserving the sanctity of customer data. You are curious, love to learn, and love to share your latest discoveries. Above all, you love shipping software as a member of a collaborative team.

Us

Pivotal Greenplum tackles the technical challenges that come with massively parallel distributed systems operating on petabytes of data across thousands of nodes. We delve into areas like query optimization, high-performance in-memory transaction and query processing, parallel and distributed execution of advanced data processing algorithms, resource management, and storage. On this team, you'll be working on hard, worthwhile problems with a collaborative team, accelerating your growth as an engineer.

Your Day

To make sure you start your day energized, we provide a catered breakfast every weekday morning, and unlimited snacks/drinks are available all day. After breakfast, the office has a daily standup as part of our Agile methodology. You will then spend much of your day pair programming in a test-driven-development method. The work culture is highly collaborative. You will have an hour lunch each day, and you'll find that we do a great job of keeping a sustainable workweek, where people leave promptly at the end of the day; we don't work long hours. Our collaborative, open-plan office space is filled with talented, like-minded engineers who enjoy taking advantage of our weekly Tech Talks, yoga classes, playing ping pong, board games and hanging out with their co-workers.

Skills / Experience

Deep, meaningful, recent development experience with one or more of the following is desired:


Database kernel or related internals
Experience with C, C++, Python, Golang or Java
In-memory object stores
SQL on hadoop
Machine learning
Query execution or cost based query optimization
Highly scalable, distributed, data driven applications
Products deployed in highly available, mission critical, enterprise environments

164,Sr. Software Engineer -- Full Stack,Very LLC,"Interviewing for a new company is a serious time commitment for all parties involved. Please take the time to read this and thoughtfully consider if we would be a good fit for one another. This is a full-time position. You must be located in the continental U.S. No contractors or agencies. Seriously. 

Why We Started Very

Not to oversimplify things, but our mission is to become the best IoT, blockchain, and machine learning product development shop in the world. We do this by hiring the best and investing heavily in them, both personally and professionally.

We Fully Embrace Working Remotely

About 30% of our team works out of our HQ in Chattanooga, TN, and the other 70% work remotely from various locations across the United States. We consider ourselves best-practitioners of the remote-first movement and believe a great team shouldnÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂt be restricted by geography.

What YouÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂll Be Working On

Very is first and foremost a software consultancy, we tackle hard problems for clients who need a targeted, senior team to come in and provide specific solutions. We are focusing heavily on building out products that have applications in one of the three following areas: 1) data science & machine learning, 2) Internet of Things, and 3) blockchain. WeÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂve found that in each of these areas, the use of the underlying technology will drive the development of the core services , but that 75% of the work often still lives in the realm of modern web development.

At Very, there is a never ending supply of variety to the types of projects we work on. In the last year weÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂve built solutions that touch e-commerce, trust management (finance), beer distribution, point of sale systems, ICOÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs, identifying fake news, and much more.

YouÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂll spend 80% of your week (Monday through Thursday) designing and building a product or platform for one of our clients. The other 20% of your week (Friday) will be spent contributing to our open source projects, internal products, learning, teaching, and participating in internal operations of all flavors. 

Project teams are small and usually made up of one or two pairs of engineers, a UX engineer, a product manager, and the client who serves as the product owner. We spend most of our time building new products, with the goal of helping our clients take it to market. We are often further engaged by our clients to continue iterating on the product once it is live. The high cost of context switching is real, so we do our best to keep teams together throughout the duration of their projects (typically 3-6 months), but have found it valuable to rotate pairing partners when it makes reasonable sense. 

We are always exploring new tools, languages, and technologies. We feel strongly that itÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs a good idea to use the best tool for the job and not see everything as a nail. We also try our best to standardize our technology and tooling across project teams so itÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs easier to rotate and practice collective code ownership. We are currently building products and platforms using the following tools / platforms:


React & React Native
Swift & Objective C
Elixir,  Phoenix, and Nerves
Arduino (embedded C/C++)
Ethereum / Solidity
Ruby on Rails
Python
Pandas
Serverless
AWS (and a dash of Heroku where it makes sense)
Given that we work on quite a bit of greenfield projects, there is often room to experiment with new patterns and tools (within reason). We donÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂt expect applicants to know our entire toolchain, but rather to be capable, flexible, and self-directed.

This Role: Senior Full-Stack Software Engineer

As a full-stack engineer at Very, you will work on a wide variety of projects and stacks. This job is a great fit for pragmatic polyglot programmers with a functional bend. Over the last few years, weÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂve shipped countless Ruby on Rails projects and are at the tail end of moving to Elixir for the bulk of our services. Additionally, we have a strong Python contingent who are utilizing the serverless framework for the development of highly targeted microservices / systems as well as for data science and machine learning projects.

We value well-tested, reusable code and expect our engineers to be as good of practitioners as they are leaders and teachers. 

How We Operate

We are believers in transparency and openness. In terms of organizational structure and governance, we are a holacracy. ItÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs worked pretty well for the us the last few years. When it comes to development processes, we do our best to adhere as closely to Extreme Programming as possible. We believe in hiring capable, responsible professionals. We donÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂt micromanage and trust everyone to work hard, experiment, learn from their mistakes, and contribute to each other and the company in a sustainable manner. We have no venture funding or external investors, which affords us the ability to be nimble and run our company in the best interest of our team as a whole.   

How YouÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂll Be Compensated

We believe in a transparent, fair compensation structure and have developed our own open salary formula. Depending on your skill and experience, you can expect to make somewhere between $80,000 and $135,000 upon joining the company. We have many health plans available through UHCÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂprices and plans vary based on your regionÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂas well as vision and dental. We currently contribute a large portion to each plan, again, amounts vary based on region.  As an added benefit, Very provides 1X Earnings Basic Life & AD&D. We have a 401k program that weÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂll provide a 2% match on after a few months working with us.

173,Global Head of Data,Lazada Services SEA,"The role
Summary:
Take ownership, train and grow the data engineering and statistical learning (""data science"") team of the largest Logistics company in South East Asia, covering a population three times the size of USÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ. We are headquartered above Tanjong Pagar in Singapore, with a great view and year round warm weather.

Situation:
Alibaba Group has injected two billion dollars into Lazada Group, a South East Asian conglomerate whose logistics arm, Lazada eLogistics (LeL), provides end to end logistics services and acts as a logistics marketplace.

LeL is a data driven business, but the data function is still embryonic. Our CEO and CTO themselves are pushing for the creation of a dedicated data engineering and data science team to take its place at the centre of the company. 

A data warehouse project has begun, with 20 systems' backend databases replicated hourly or live into a multi-TB PostgreSQL instance. A ""clean"" (normalised) schema is created from it, a set of views that organises the data into a form that represents the real logic of the business cross-systems. The ""raw"" schema contains all the replicated databases, the ""logical"" schema contains the cross-system normalised information, and we're now building the part that gets from the first to the second. The result will be one of the largest relational PostgreSQL deployment in the world.

The next compulsory steps will be:


To complete writing the raw-to-logical mapping, thus modelling and implementing a clean view of all the company's information.
To assist, train, mentor and otherwise lead the existing team into completing the mapping.
To replicate the functional spec of all existing data products within the company (mostly reports).
To expand the team to cover skillsets not currently present or trainable.
To build and provide the ability for the team to answer any question from any part of the business promptly and correctly (such as ""what is the average time a package between 2 and 5kg spends being picked in cold storage zones between 9 and 11am in Thailand and Myanmar a week after Chinese New Year"").
Optional paths thereafter could be:


To assist the CEO and CTO with their existing statistical learning projects, such as optimising the routing of millions of packages through multiple transport companies and warehouses internationally.
To think of, develop and deploy other data-driven projects such as optimising warehouse picking operations or inventory management.
To train local teams capable of doing the same independently, and support their efforts. This involves travelling around Asia.
Likely useful experience:


Software development (aside from building actual software, you'll need to read a lot of code to understand systems whose logic is not at database level).
A mathematical bend, including awareness of and respect for the ideas behind the relational model (""predicate logic on sets"") as defined by Edgar Codd and Chris Date, and rich data types. If you see a foreign key as a mathematical domain and think in terms of relation values and variables, we are probably on the same page.
Knowing your way around PostgreSQL, or failing that any large scale RDBMS deployment; there are infrastructure teams and DBAs but they need your guidance.
At least some enjoyment of the resolution of large, complex problems using more abstract methods as opposed to quick hacks and duct tape.
UNIX/Linux, but if you've read that far you probably have more than enough experience. 
Speaking Chinese (Mandarin) may help a bit but the team has multiple native speakers.
Interview process:


Email vanessa.tan@lazada.com to be sent a few quick questions. Include ""6h9mYszLTq2Y"" in the subject line so we know you're not a bot.
An hour or two over Skype for probing your technical experience.
An hour or two in Singapore (if you are there) or over Skype for the C-levels to figure out if they can work with you.

176,Python Developer,Seth Godin,"Overview

We're looking for a Python developer to help us continue development of our (mostly) internal-facing web apps. See the current project section for specifics of this gig.

What do we do? We teach leadership to high-performing individuals who want to level up (altmba.com), and we teach marketing that you can be proud of because it's ethical, generous, and effective (themarketingseminar.com). 

In the process we're trying to change online education. Most online courses have a massive drop-out rate, and don't create an environment that enables the student to grow. 

The apps are dashboards and onboarding sites that helps us manage our student experience.

We're looking for someone we can work with long-term, but to start we're going to focus on one new piece of functionality we need to add to the apps.

This is a freelance position, working remotely.

Current Project

We need a UI that lets Sam upload a CSV of students, and gives her back a CSV of payment links for each student. 

We're currently doing this semi-manually. Alex modifies a few config files and then runs a python script from Heroku's command line. Much of the functionality is already developed. What we need is a bit more functionality to check the CSV to make sure it's formatted correctly, and a UI that let's Sam set the config variables and run the process from the web app. 

Tech Notes

The app is built using a procedural programming style (not object-oriented).

Since the app is (mostly) internal-facing we value speed and getting to ""good enough,"" more than we care about performance optimization or eliminating all the bugs. This lets us work in a fast, iterative manner. 

Tech stack


Python 3 
Flask web application framework

Heroku PostgreSQL (via psycopg2 without an ORM)

Heerlen ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ 36 uur

Spreken moderne IT-themaÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs zoals domain driven architectuur, continuous delivery, automatic release management en metadata jou aan? Zie jij het als een uitdaging om te participeren in complexe IT-projecten en deze te begeleiden? Wil jij aan de slag in een ongekend groot applicatielandschap?

Wat ga je doen?

Uit onze laatste sprintreview blijkt dat onze product owners tevreden zijn over onze dienstverlening. We worden daardoor steeds eerder in het proces betrokken en daar zijn we trots op! Vanuit onze ambitie om steeds meer en beter in vaste Scrum teams te gaan werken, vervul jij als Software Architect een cruciale en verbindende rol tussen onze afdeling en de interne klant.

In onze state-of-the-art data en informatie infrastructuur in Heerlen bedenk je ontwerpbeslissingen voor de implementatie van gewenste functionaliteit met behulp van de uiteindelijke techniek. Vanuit jouw kennis en kunde, en adviserende rol, kun jij jouw visie overtuigend neerzetten bij product owners en treedt je op als volwaardig gesprekspartner.

Als meewerkend voorman neem jij de software engineers mee in jouw werkwijze en vind je het leuk inhoudelijke discussies te voeren, om zo van elkaar te leren.

Doordat je een actieve en betrokken rol hebt in grote en complexe projecten, zoals ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂproject DatameerÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ, ben je regelmatig proactief aan de slag met complexe vraagstukken. Enkele van de vraagstukken waar jij je mee bezig mag houden zijn:
Hoe kun je met innovatieve technieken en concepten zoals datavirtualisatie, graph databases, open sourcetools, logical datawarehouse- en metadata concepten en platformen ontwikkelen waarbij statistische data bij de bronnen blijven opgeslagen en op een snelle en eenvoudige manier real-time via een datawebshop ontsloten kunnen worden aan de gebruikers en systemen van het CBS?

Maar ook:Hoe kun je dit platform en concept vervolgens laten uitgroeien tot een platform om data op een veilige maner real-time te delen met externe partijen als overheden, universiteiten, gemeenten en provincies?

Binnen dit project werk je met open source tools en ben je verantwoordelijk voor het integreren van totaaloplossingen. Hiernaast werk je zelf ook hand-on mee in ontwikkelwerkzaamheden.

Wie zoeken wij?

Wij zijn op zoek naar een betrokken en proactieve senior architect die bij voorkeur kennis heeft van datawarehouses en metadata. Hiernaast zien we graag de volgende zaken terug in je cv/brief:


Je beschikt minimaal over een afgeronde HBO opleiding (bij voorkeur informatica of aanverwant)

Je hebt minimaal 2 jaar ervaring als Software Architect, bij voorkeur binnen een of meerdere grote/ complexe organisaties

Je hebt affiniteit met open source tools en bent in staat totaal oplossingen te integreren

Je hebt bij grote voorkeur ervaring in het werken binnen Scrum en/of DevOps teams

Waar kom je te werken?
De directie BIT (Informatietechnologie) bestaat uit 5 afdelingen; Applicatie Services, Technical Services, Customer Services, Solution Services en Stafbureau kwaliteit. BIT is verantwoordelijk voor het beschikbaar stellen ontwikkelen en in stand houden (continuÃÂÃÂ¯teit) van de ICT infrastructuur, staat garant voor ontwikkeling en onderhoud van maatwerk applicaties en is verantwoordelijk voor beheer van maatwerk en standaard applicaties.

IT werkt keihard aan het beheren en vernieuwen van de infrastructuurdiensten, is actief in vele scrumprojecten voor applicatieontwikkeling, investeert nadrukkelijk in het uitbreiden en professionaliseren van IT en zit middenin een belangrijke transitieperiode om aan de steeds toenemende behoefte aan hoogwaardige IT-dienstverlening te kunnen blijven voldoen en toonaangevende resultaten neer te zetten.

IT is, vanwege de grote verwerking van data binnen de organisatie, de ruggengraat van het CBS en speelt daarmee een grote en zeer essentiÃÂÃÂ«le rol binnen de organisatie. De IT binnen het CBS moet dan ook betrouwbaar zijn, daar maken wij ons elke dag hard voor!

Het team
Als team BAS (BIT Applicatie Services) Heerlen hebben we de afgelopen jaren de eerste stappen gezet in Agile werken. De projecten worden uitgevoerd in vaste scrum teams. Het is onze ambitie om hierin steeds te blijven doorgroeien in professionaliteit en effectiviteit, door bijvoorbeeld te groeien in scrum volwassenheid, invulling geven aan DevOps, zoveel mogelijk te automatiseren en steeds met state-of-te art IT te werken. Het totale team van BAS H bestaat uit ca. 40 collegaÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs in Heerlen. Er is ook een BAS team in Den Haag bestaande uit ca. 30 collegaÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs.

SENIOR MOBILE DEV (F/M), HAMBURG

The Digital Unit is looking for a talented mobile dev to join our team. In the heart of HafenCity, Hamburg, the Digital Unit is driving the digital transformation at Costa Group (AIDA & Costa Cruises). As a mobile dev with us, you will work with other developers, user experience designers, data analysts and product owners to develop and improve new features while keeping performance, scalability and deployment in mind.

Your code will deploy to and run on the floating cities of the sea - cruise ships. This unique situation calls for a mixed and adaptable set of coding skills. Often the usual taken for granted solutions simply don't work when deployed to a ship. If the sound of this challenge is getting you excited - we'd love to meet you!

THE 'TECH STACK'

We use a variety of technologies to code and ship our products. If Swift for iOS/tvOS, Kotlin for Android or advanced mobile web development tickles your fancy, let's talk! Of course, you're not expected to have mastered it all but deep knowledge of some, along with a hunger to learn new things as needed, is desired.

WHO YOU ARE:

You are an expert in your area, familiar with mobile development challenges as well as sitting down to do some solid functional programming to extend a Backend For Frontend (BFF).
You fancy applying CI/CD techniques and writing automated tests.
You have solid understanding of the full application technology stack, as well as how to handle dropped internet connections in applications.
You could ship an entire mobile app on your own if you wanted to, but prefer working with others to write well-designed, tested, and scalable software in pairs.
You are comfortable communicating in English for coding and in meetings (we try not to have too many).

WHAT WE OFFER:

A bunch of challenges.
A dynamic company culture in the heart of Hamburg in HafenCity.
A team that values the opinions of each member, no matter the role.
A snazzy open office space, with a pro kicker table, conference rooms, a phone booth and a shower.
HVV ProfiTicket discount.
Weekly fresh fruit, free coffee, and water.
Competitive compensation.

194,Senior Software Engineer,Stride Consulting,"Join our Family 

Stride Consulting is a mission-driven, engineering-centric company. We seek developers who place a high value on continuous learning, and value diversity. If you consider yourself a non-dogmatic engineer, have a thirst for learning, and an eye for process, youÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂre in great company. 

Our goal is to leave our clients functioning at a higher level than when we found them.  We do this by writing high quality code alongside them, and by mentoring their developers, product teams and stakeholders in software development best practices. 

We believe that practices like Test Driven Development, Pairing and Refactoring are the foundation of a high functioning software team. And, we believe that not all Agile practices provide equal value to all teams at all times. So, we approach each engagement as the unique opportunity it is. 

As a Strider, youÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂll find an opportunity thatÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs unmatched. You will:


Be part of an engineering-driven culture, one that has a 4.9 star Glassdoor review and thatÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs won CrainÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs Best Places to Work 2 years in a row.
Write high-quality code with some of the smartest engineers in town.
Mentor Stride and client engineers.
Immerse yourself in a learning journey thatÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs second to none. No where else will you find the variety that being a consultant brings, all a subway ride away.
Day In The Life of a Senior Software Engineer

You are empowered to define what work/life balance means to you. As a Strider, youÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂll work onsite at your client. We are proud to call some of NYCÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs most outstanding tech teams our clients, from startups to enterprise.  

You will be part of a Stride team, on a client engagement. Your work week will involve 70%-80% client work, including coding, and mentoring Agile engineering best practices. The rest of your time will be spent on things like: managing Striders, being the engagement lead on your client, owning company-level initiatives, being a thought leader.

                                                     HereÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs how a day might unfold:


9am: One-on-one meeting with the clientÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs CTO.  IÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂm the engagement lead on my client. I meet with the CTO weekly. We go over the plans for the week and give each other feedback. I take notes so I can relay the info to the team. 

10am: Daily Standup. Standup lasts 5 minutes and then weÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂre off to code.

10:10-12:30 Pair Programming. This morning, IÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂm pairing with another Strider. SheÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs been coding 3 years, and sheÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs got strong fundamentals. WeÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂre doing a deep dive into complex backend code. IÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂm asking questions when I see she gets stuck. She notices a refactoring opportunity and we jump in. 

12:30-1:30 Lunch with my team Every Strider gets a company AmEx. WeÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂre encouraged to grab lunch, coffee with our team and/or client to get to know each other. We talk business for 30 minutes and the rest of the time we talk about rock climbing and a new strategy board game Derek bought last week.

1:30-4:00 Pair Programming

4- 5:Sprint Retrospective Retrospectives on my team are amazing. We take turns facilitating, and today we retrospect our last release. 

5-6: Stride U DevOps Jam Stride U is ongoing education for Striders by Striders. Seven of us are taking the DevOps Jam course, itÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs 1 hour weekly, for 8 weeks.  DevOps is something IÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂm dipping a toe in and having a safe space to learn real world stuff that I can bring back to my client is great. 

6pm: Leave for the Day. ItÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs been a good day, I throw on my headphones as I head to the subway. 

                                                               What youÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂll be doing

205,"SENIOR FULL-STACK DEV WITH RUBY/PYTHON/REACT -- 100% REMOTE, FLEXIBLE HOURS",Analytics Fire,"Job Description

Analytics Fire builds custom software for the solar power industry. WeÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂre looking for a senior full-stack developer with a willingness to acquire deep expertise around Ruby, Python, and React.js, in order to help us expand to support additional new high-tech sectors.

Analytics Fire is a small, distributed team working on a range of interesting projects. For example, last year we worked on a scalable IoT platform for utility grade solar power plants, a sales and design tool for residential solar, and a machine-learning powered autonomous cleaning robot. WeÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂre looking for a fun, reliable, and highly collaborative, senior dev to join our team.
For reference, here is a list of technologies and tools we are currently actively using on a day-to-day basis:


Front-end: JavaScript / React / Angular
Back-end: Ruby / Python / Node.js
Embedded (IoT): C, Embedded Linux, MQTT
Embedded (robotics): C/C++, ROS
Modern software techniques: RESTful APIs, SOA, PaaS, etc
Agile collaboration and DevOps tools: Github, Trello, Slack, Chef, Ansible, Docker, Vagrant, etc
Occasionally we need to do a small amount of work around: SFDC, iOS, Android, ARKit
This is a remote position. WeÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂre flexible about location and hours, so long as your working hours are in a very heavily US-overlapping time zone (eg: North America, Central America, South America, etc). WeÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂre a really great match for a senior dev in a US-overlapping timezone who wants to work hard on interesting projects, while also having flexibility around time and geography.

Skills & Requirements

Ideally, you should have 5+ years commercial full stack development, ideally within a startup environment. You should be comfortable autonomously driving your own high quality / high velocity contributions using a range of technologies.

We work with a variety of technologies, but are currently specifically looking for someone that has or can obtain expert level skills around Python, Ruby, and React.js.

About Analytics Fire

ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂOur goal founding, Analytics Fire, was to create the engineering department that we always dreamed of working for. Our dream is to be able to spend our time working on interesting problems, while simultaneously having flexibility around time and geography and being part of a small, tightly-knit team of world-class engineers.ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ",http://github-jobs.s3.amazonaws.com/17ab996c-1952-11e8-81e3-b60098bb6179.jpg,http://jobs.github.com/positions/95048694-1952-11e8-86d5-38e7f24d7ed9,Github Jobs,"Data & Analytics, Development Tools, Software Engineering, Design Tools, Sales, Analytics & Automation, Industry","226,232,239,244,245,257,270,275,276,278,283,285,299,304,319,328,329,331,334,344,357,379,381,382,383,392,419,420,437,454,455,457,459,472,473,483,489,494,529,552,573,586,591,619,643,673,677,701,729,750,770,814,817,911,942,1027,1111,1128,1171,1190,1317,1332,1410,1424,1429,1460,1463,1466,1488,1496,1516,1532,1646,1795,1809,1870,1947,2021,2050,2273,2473,2506,2508,2518,2527,2591,2610","27,41,45,67,78,90,118",Remote,Full Time

WeÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂre currently working on building new kinds of products for new markets, each with their own unique set of technical and design challenges. Our success lies in being able to plan out what resources and deliverables weÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂll need, predict when weÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂll be able to complete them, and make informed trade-offs along the way.

We donÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂt expect you to have worked on the exact kinds of products weÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂre building, but we are looking for experience in product development projects with cross-functional teams and within distributed systems. We have several scrum teams working in software development sprints, alongside electrical and mechanical engineering, manufacturing, quality engineering, and marketing teams, all relying on each otherÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs work to enable success for our products, our customers, and our company. Your focus will be on enabling the engineering teamÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs deliverables and communicate those delivery schedules to the rest of the company. 

At Orion, we deeply value productive dialogue, continuous improvement, and a team-first mindset. We're looking for someone who takes pride in being an eager learner, a clear communicator, and a dedicated collaborator. This role will be an opportunity to build great products with a great team, in a fast-paced but supportive environment. You'll have the chance to grow with the company as it expands and takes on new and exciting challenges.

We use innovative technology, a scientific approach, and a deep understanding of markets to stay successful in our highly competitive field. We operate around the clock and around the globe, employing over 500 people in offices in New York, London and Hong Kong.

The markets in which we trade change rapidly, but our intellectual approach changes faster still. Every day, we have new problems to solve and new theories to test. Our entrepreneurial culture is driven by our talented team of traders and programmers. At Jane Street, we don't come to work wanting to leave. We come to work excited to test new theories, have thought-provoking discussions, and maybe sneak in a game of ping-pong or two. Keeping our culture casual and our employees happy is of paramount importance to us.

As Jane Street grows, the quality of the development tools we use matters more and more.  We increasingly work on the OCaml compiler itself: adding useful language features, fine-tuning the type system and improving the performance of the generated code. Alongside this, we also work on the surrounding toolchain, developing new tools for profiling, debugging, documentation and build automation.

We're looking to hire a developer with experience working on compilers to join us. That experience might be from working on a production compiler in industry or from working on research compilers in an academic setting. No previous experience with OCaml or functional programming languages is required.

224,Leading SAAS Searching for Senior Full-Stack Developer & Project Lead,SixLeaf,"Who We Are:

SixLeaf is the leading marketing platform for third party sellers on Amazon.com as well as a variety of other e-commerce marketplaces. We offer a suite of complete software solutions for brands, both big and small, selling online. These solutions significantly improve marketplace performance and profit for our clients. Simply: we help Brands become ecommerce empires.

Since 2014, our mission has beento help as many brands as possible scale to the point where they are household names. And our goal is to be the very best at it. Since 2014, weÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂve established ourselves as the revolutionary innovators in a fast-paced industry. By helping quality brands grow, not only can we assist our clients to achieve their dreams, but we make the market a better place for consumers. Each member of our team shares in the joy and responsibility of making the ecommerce world a better place.

What We Are Looking For:

We are, essentially, looking for a Unicorn, and we understand this. We are searching for a capable, full-stack developer with leadership skills. Our project managers have superior coding capabilities because our projects are complex, and we arenÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂt looking for a project lead who only understands the lingo.

We need someone who can get into the codebase and get their hands dirty when necessary. The project lead will write the backlog and assign tasks to developers working on the project, but may also help correct complicated issues, and on particularly hairy deadlines, may also assist in coding.

WeÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂre looking for a self-starter and a team player who is able to adapt to a rapidly growing and evolving organization in an industry that moves fast. WeÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂre looking for a leader who can act as a multiplier and makes others around them better through automation, code review, documentation, mentoring when necessary, and who can lead a small team confidently. WeÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂre looking for a true software owner who genuinely cares about the impact our platform makes on the client and their Brand. And weÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂre looking for the naturally curious developer who doesnÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂt just accept engineering challenges - they embrace challenges and seek them out.

Why Work With Us?

SixLeaf was originally founded in 2014 as ZonBlast - a tool which completely revolutionized the Amazon marketing space. In the last 4 years, weÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂve grown exponentially, have been featured at major industry events, on podcasts, and have proudly served thousands of Brand owners. WeÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂve had the honor of having a direct hand in taking entrepreneurs from mere idea to 7+ figure Brands.

As a team, we consider working for our early-stage tech startup a lifetyle choice, rather than a job choice. Working for SixLeaf can be challenging at times. We operate in a competitive and fast moving industry, so we need to hit aggressive deadlines and there are many times when everyone on the team puts in a lot more hours than they are used to. YouÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂll work hard but youÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂll face exciting challenges that allow you to put your mark on the world.

As an important part of the SixLeaf team, youÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂll be responsible for creating innovative tools that help turn our clientÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs BrandsÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ into e-commerce empires. YouÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂll design beautifully simple yet effective solutions that, once released, will provide measurable and direct impact clientsÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ businesses.

As a valued SixLeaf team member, youÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂll: 


Learn Something New: It is very unlikely youÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂve ever worked on a project quite like this. YouÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂll be exposed to a fascinating and challenging new world where you will be learning about an incredibly exciting industry that is still in its infancy. You will immediately make a difference and impact on SixLeaf, its customers, and this industry.
Make More Money: To put it bluntly; we are generous. As a startup, we donÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂt quite have each benchmark that determines bonus structures and pay increases set in stone yet, but we have consistently been extremely giving. WeÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂve given a bonus each year for the ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂChristmasÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ season. WeÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂve given raises after each 90-day probationary period. We also regularly increase pay based on exemplary performance. 
Expand Your Skillset: YouÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂll be exposed to developers around the world who each bring a unique set of skills to the table. YouÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂll also be learning the intricacies of a relatively new industry to the SAAS space, which will require expansion on current knowledge. Overall, you will walk away from this job a more capable and productive individual having learned from the best in the industry.
At SixLeaf, and as a fully distributed team, we value respect, transparency, dedication, and innovation. We honor our respective team-members strengths by promoting collaboration.

In addition, we offer:


Generous pay, benefits, and performance-based bonuses
Generous paid time off policy
Ability to work remotely in a fully distributed team connected by tools like Slack, Zoom, and more
Access to a growing library of industry-specific educational material that will help you deliver the best for our clients
Flexible results-driven schedule
A team that has cares immeasurably about the results it provides for clients. We take what we do seriously. We know that the results we obtain for clients by way of the software you will help create and improve have direct impacts on entrepreneursÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ businesses, families, and lives.

What We Need:

Developers are some of the brightest and most amazing people on the planet. However, they can also tend to overcomplicate things. Often, if you ask a developer to turn on a light, heÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂll try to build a machine using complex algorithms and a system of wires to engage the light mechanism from their side of the room rather than just walk over to the switch and flip it.

What we need is a project lead that brings balance between genius ideas and common sense solutions. Someone who is nimble, cross-disciplinary, and mindful of client needs. Someone who embraces being a key player in the leadership team. And someone who is results-driven, focused on problem-solving and who can act as a multiplier in any team. If you are an out of the box thinker who loves to invent creative ways to solve problems while also seeing the simplest path, this may be for you.

If you arenÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂt afraid of hard work and want to be a part of a growing team hell-bent on taking over an entire niche, we may be a fit for each other.

226,Experienced Software Engineers,Loco2,"Loco2's mission is to make booking trains anywhere in Europe as easy and affordable as possible, from epic international adventures to everyday local commutes. Our booking coverage is unrivalled and growing.

We're looking for 2 experienced Ruby engineers to join our existing team of six, where you'll help us maintain and improve our existing infrastructure, integrate new rail operator booking systems and scale effectively for our rapidly expanding user base.

At Loco2 we care deeply about building an inclusive, open and supportive work environment. We behave with respect for people and the planet and are seeking a diverse range of candidates that share these values.

About us

We're a small, passionate and cosmopolitan team, with a healthy remote-first culture and an office in London. Our success is built on trust, empathy and shared knowledge, with our users at the centre of what we do. We're proud to have an average rating of 9.3 out of 10 on Trustpilot after 22,000 reviews.

WeÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂve been selling tickets since 2012 (read our full story here), and weÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂre growing rapidly as the business matures. Our goal is to scale effectively whilst continuing to delight our users.

Why join us?


We have high codings standards, and follow best practices such as continuous testing and delivery
We strive to learn and improve together in a supportive environment as the wider tech ecosystem evolves
Our team enjoys a healthy work-life balance and donÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂt think caffeine-fuelled all-nighters are a good way to grow a company thatÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs built to last
We offer flexible hours and a well-designed remote working culture built on trust. Work around your schedule and when youÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂre most productive
Our days are not full of meetings and needless distractions, allowing others to achieve flow is a big part of supporting each other
Everyone is encouraged to ask questions, think creatively and suggest new working practices. We have a small team so your voice will be heard
You will be provided with a laptop and are empowered to make changes that improve your working environment
Technical challenges

Our software stack consists of a pure-Ruby backend library which we use to communicate with train booking APIs, a modern Rails application, a PostgreSQL database, and two native mobile applications (iOS and Android).

WeÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂre integrated with multiple rail operator booking systems (with our current team we usually complete at least 1-2 major integrations each year), and weÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂre increasingly consuming other types of data too (e.g. timetable data for routing, real-time arrivals/departures etc).

We need to diligently manage technical complexity, as each external system works in a slightly different way, with its own features and quirks. SOAP is (unfortunately) used by many operator APIs, which is why we released our open source library, LolSoap.

Some of the most difficult challenges we face relate to routing and making sense of lots of data. Which routes are best to get from A to B? Which booking systems should be queried? How might we cache data without affecting accuracy of results?

WeÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂve recently released mobile applications for iOS and Android. Further developing our mobile strategy is a key goal for the business.

Because Loco2 is the merchant of record for all transactions we are also responsible for fraud prevention, and handling currency and other finance-related issues.

We frequently release new features that drive rapid organic growth, and so itÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs vital that we anticipate and address scaling challenges before they occur.

About you

An ideal candidate:


Has 4+ years of professional programming experience
Has deep knowledge and experience of Ruby
Is fluent in English and confident communicating and sharing complex information and learnings with both technical and non-technical team members
Has a good working knowledge of modern devops technologies such as Docker
Is comfortable designing object oriented software from scratch, not just implementing CRUD Rails apps; a pragmatist who can see the trade-offs involved in the different approaches to solving a problem
Strives to discover and understand the root cause of problems, suggesting new and improved solutions, rather than treating the symptoms
Actively considers future maintainability when deciding how to implement something
Has a keen appetite for self-improvement and growth, but doesn't hesitate to ask for help when needed

Can work hours that have some overlap with London daytime
Is motivated by Loco2's mission

231,Senior Software Engineer -- Javascript,Very LLC,"Interviewing for a new company is a serious time commitment for all parties involved. Please take the time to read this and thoughtfully consider if we would be a good fit for one another. This is a full-time position. You must be located in the continental U.S. No contractors or agencies. Seriously. 

Why We Started Very

Not to oversimplify things, but our mission is to become the best IoT, blockchain, and machine learning product development shop in the world. We do this by hiring the best and investing heavily in them, both personally and professionally.

We Fully Embrace Working Remotely

About 30% of our team works out of our HQ in Chattanooga, TN, and the other 70% work remotely from various locations across the United States. We consider ourselves best-practitioners of the remote-first movement and believe a great team shouldnÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂt be restricted by geography.

What YouÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂll Be Working On

Very is first and foremost a software consultancy, we tackle hard problems for clients who need a targeted, senior team to come in and provide specific solutions. We are focusing heavily on building out products that have applications in one of the three following areas: 1) data science & machine learning, 2) Internet of Things, and 3) blockchain. WeÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂve found that in each of these areas, the use of the underlying technology will drive the development of the core services , but that 75% of the work often still lives in the realm of modern web development.

At Very, there is a never ending supply of variety to the types of projects we work on. In the last year weÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂve built solutions that touch e-commerce, trust management (finance), beer distribution, point of sale systems, ICOÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs, identifying fake news, and much more.

YouÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂll spend 80% of your week (Monday through Thursday) designing and building a product or platform for one of our clients. The other 20% of your week (Friday) will be spent contributing to our open source projects, internal products, learning, teaching, and participating in internal operations of all flavors. 

Project teams are small and usually made up of one or two pairs of engineers, a UX engineer, a product manager, and the client who serves as the product owner. We spend most of our time building new products, with the goal of helping our clients take it to market. We are often further engaged by our clients to continue iterating on the product once it is live. The high cost of context switching is real, so we do our best to keep teams together throughout the duration of their projects (typically 3-6 months), but have found it valuable to rotate pairing partners when it makes reasonable sense. 

We are always exploring new tools, languages, and technologies. We feel strongly that itÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs a good idea to use the best tool for the job and not see everything as a nail. We also try our best to standardize our technology and tooling across project teams so itÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs easier to rotate and practice collective code ownership. We are currently building products and platforms using the following tools / platforms:


React & React Native
Swift & Objective C
Elixir,  Phoenix, and Nerves
Arduino (embedded C/C++)
Ethereum / Solidity
Ruby on Rails
Python
Pandas
Serverless
AWS (and a dash of Heroku where it makes sense)
Given that we work on quite a bit of greenfield projects, there is often room to experiment with new patterns and tools (within reason). We donÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂt expect applicants to know our entire toolchain, but rather to be capable, flexible, and self-directed.

This Role:  Senior Software Engineer // Javascript

Over the past few years, weÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂve seen client-side engineering emerge as its own discipline, and we are looking for individuals who thrive in the front end and want to further their practice. Ideal candidates not only have a solid engineering background, but a passion for client-side development as well. 
We value well-tested, reusable code and expect our engineers to be as good of practitioners as they are leaders and teachers. 

How We Operate

We are believers in transparency and openness. In terms of organizational structure and governance, we are a holacracy. ItÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs worked pretty well for the us the last few years. When it comes to development processes, we do our best to adhere as closely to Extreme Programming as possible. We believe in hiring capable, responsible professionals. We donÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂt micromanage and trust everyone to work hard, experiment, learn from their mistakes, and contribute to each other and the company in a sustainable manner. We have no venture funding or external investors, which affords us the ability to be nimble and run our company in the best interest of our team as a whole.   

How YouÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂll Be Compensated

We believe in a transparent, fair compensation structure and have developed our own open salary formula. Depending on your skill and experience, you can expect to make somewhere between $80,000 and $135,000 upon joining the company. We have many health plans available through UHCÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂprices and plans vary based on your regionÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂas well as vision and dental. We currently contribute a large portion to each plan, again, amounts vary based on region.  As an added benefit, Very provides 1X Earnings Basic Life & AD&D. We have a 401k program that weÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂll provide a 2% match on after a few months working with us. Lastly, 35% of the companyÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs ownership is reserved for a team member options pool.",http://github-jobs.s3.amazonaws.com/a4da71c6-18b4-11e8-8455-455ff055b230.png,http://jobs.github.com/positions/a946a234-18b4-11e8-8fe6-c05d1d2bc0f8,Github Jobs,"Core Finance, Web Development, Programming Languages, Personal Finance, Data & Analytics, Operating Systems, Finance, Project Management, Software Testing, Development Tools, Web Design, Software Engineering, Management, Motivation, Productivity, Design Tools, Production, Sales, Test Taking Skills, Teaching Tools, Operations, E-Commerce, Fitness, Other Programming, Product Marketing","144,145,146,147,148,149,150,151,152,153","14,22,24,26,27,30,32,37,40,41,44,45,56,60,63,67,76,78,89,98,100,103,106,108,122","Chattanooga, TN",Full Time

247,Humbly Confident Senior Mobile Developer,YNAB (You Need A Budget),"At YNAB, we build the worldÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs best budgeting software. But weÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂre even prouder of teaching people how to align their money and their priorities, and in turn changing their lives.

We have big plans for our iOS and Android apps. In the Summer of 2017 we brought most of the functionality of the web app to our mobile apps, and now weÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂre looking to take them even further.

If youÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂre the one weÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂre looking for, you have extensive experience with iOS or Android and are excited to help us with both platforms. Heck, youÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂre also excited about getting to work with the TypeScript and SQL we use in our shared library. This isnÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂt your first rodeo. YouÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂve got 5 or more years of experience, and can point to multiple applications you have helped ship.

ThatÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs a super-brief intro of what youÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂll be working on. But first, you need to know if youÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂll even like working with us. We think you will.

A Bit About Us

We build the best budgeting software around, YNAB or ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂYou Need a BudgetÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ if you have a lot of extra time on your hands. For more than a decade, people have been buying YNAB and then telling their friends what a difference it has made in their lives. (Google us, and youÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂll see what we mean.) We love building something that has a huge positive impact on peopleÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs lives.

WeÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂre profitable, bootstrapped, and growing. YNAB started in 2004 and we havenÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂt taken any outside fundingÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂweÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂre in it for the long haul.

We have one overarching requirement when it comes to joining our team: our Cultural Manifesto has to really click with you. If youÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂre nodding emphatically while reading it, youÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂll probably fit right in!

First, letÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs talk about life at YNAB and then weÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂll go into detail about what weÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂre looking for.

Who youÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂd be working with:

Our developer team is 12 people strong, but we all work pretty closely. For that matter, we also work in cross-functional teams frequently so you'll get to work with people in all different roles in the company. As a small sampling though, here are a few that you'll definitely rub digital shoulders with:

Taylor, our CTO, was our digital nomad for a couple of years while he travelled...pretty much everywhere. He's now slowing down a bit and lives in Austin Texas, where he's learning to flex his handyman muscles while renovating their home. He's exceptionally good at escape room games and his super skill is explaining the rules of a board game in the most concise and understandable way you've ever heard. He also wins a lot of those board games.

Sebastian, our mobile lead developer, works mostly on the iOS side of things here at YNAB. When he's not busy at YNAB he's either out walking the dogs, pretending to be a firefighter, feeding the cats or playing with his new server rack in the barn. He lives in rural Switzerland which might explain the barn - and by rural we mean it'd take you an hour to get to Zurich.

Graham, our Android tech lead, is on a mission to convert everything to RxJava and Kotlin, and is constantly dabbling with various architecture patterns and solutions for cross-platform code-sharing. He lives in Scotland, where he hopes to one day be a decent enough guitarist to play a tune and actually have someone recognize it.

He's an aviation geek who obsessively binge-watches entire seasons of Air Crash Investigations, just in case it might come in useful someday.

How YouÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂll Work at YNAB

We work really hard to make working at YNAB an amazing experience. We have a team full of truly exceptional peopleÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂthe kind youÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂll be excited to work with. HereÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs how we operate:

Live Where You Want.
WeÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂre a distributed team, so you can live and work wherever you want. Proximity doesnÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂt influence productivity. Just make sure you have a reliable internet connection.

No Crazy Hours.
We rarely work more than 40 hours per week. There have been a few occasions where things got a little crazy and people had to log some extra hours. But then they took some extra time off, so it all balances out. We work hard and smart but weÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂre in this for the long haul, no need to go crazy on the hours.

Take Vacation (Seriously).
We want you to take vacation. In fact, we have a minimum vacation policy of three weeks per year (plus two extra weeks for Christmas break). ItÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs important to get out and do something. WeÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂll look forward to seeing pictures of your vacation in our internal chat room, creatively named #office_wall.

The YNAB Retreat.
We get the teams together once a year to catch up on spreadsheets and powerpoints in a Best Western conference room. Just kidding. So far, weÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂve done Costa Rica, a gigantic cabin in the mountains, and a beach house in the Outer Banks. This year is a ranch in Montana. We do really fun things, but the highlight is always just hanging out together and having a blast.

Up Your Game.
WeÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂre serious about helping you improve your craft. We budget for it (hey-o!).. Think conferences, Lynda subscriptions, books, dedicated time away from work to learn something new... itÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs really up to you and your manager. But we love to see our people growing.  

If YouÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂre International...
YouÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂll be set up as a contractor. Employee or contractor, itÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs all the same to us. YouÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂre part of the team. As for time zones, weÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂre flexible as long as a decent chunk of your time overlaps with North American time zones.

If YouÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂre StatesideÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¦
YouÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂll be a W2 employee with fantastic health, dental, and vision insurance, where we cover 100% of the premium for you and your family. (No need to check your vision, you read that right, 100%. Although if you did need to check your vision, no big deal, weÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂve got you covered!)

We also have Traditional and Roth 401k options. YNAB contributes three percent whether you choose to throw any money in there or not. It vests immediately. (Are you a personal finance junkie like Jesse? He set up YNABÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs 401k to have the lowest fee structure possible, where all plan costs are paid by YNAB, not your retirement nest egg. The investment funds available are fantastic, passively-managed, ultra low-cost index funds. YouÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂre not a PF junkie? Then trust us, itÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs great.)

Other Tidbits


Once you start, we DEMAND (in a friendly, ALL CAPS IS YELLING way) that you fill out your ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂBucket ListÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ spreadsheet with 50 items. (ThatÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs harder than it sounds!)
The bucket list helps in deciding what we should give you for your birthday and Christmas: No gift cards here. We tried that. Super boring.
We have a bonus plan based on profitability. YouÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂll be in on that from day one. YNAB wins, you win. That kind of thing.
WeÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂre all adults. ThereÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs no need to punch a clock, or ask for permission to take off early one afternoon to go see the doctor (health insurance premium 100% covered!). We look at what youÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂre accomplishing, not how long you sit (have you tried standing?) in front of a computer.
We want you firing on all cylinders so weÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂll set you up with a shiny new computer and replace it every three years.
Did I mention we make a huge, positive difference in peopleÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs lives? We have a Slack channel where we share success stories from our customers daily. ItÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs amazing. DonÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂt underestimate this one!
If this sounds like your ideal environment, read on because now I want to talk about you. You will play a big part in helping YNAB delight users and give them control of their money.  You will change lives. 

Now, back to you, our new Mobile DeveloperÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¦

You're a mobile developer with over 5 years of experience. At least two of those have been spent working with either iOS or Android, or both. (If you have experience with only one, youÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂre excited to work with the other. We love both platforms for different reasons, and want you to as well.)  You know how to write easy-to-maintain software while still keeping an eye on the roadmap.

You'll help us implement new features and maintain existing apps on both iOS and Android. We have native implementations for each platform but use a shared library based on TypeScript for things that, well, need to be shared across platforms. For performance and maintainability reasons there is plenty of SQL code as well. You don't have to be an expert on TypeScript or SQL, but being curious about how things work on that layer will definitely help. Our baselines are Lollipop on Android and iOS 9 on iOS. You'll get to work with things like Kotlin and RxJava on Android. On iOS you'll work with Objective-C and Swift on a universal app and an Apple watch app.

YouÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂre the one weÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂre looking for if you:


Are an excellent developer and can adapt to new languages quickly.
Write code that is easy for other programmers to understand and use.
Have excellent debugging skills. You know how to find problems, and how to architect apps so that problems are discoverable in the first place.
Are self-motivated and thrive with directions like:
""This part of the program is too slow, and these are the places that might be good to start looking.""
""This component needs to be re-architected to allow for X. How do you think we should do it?""
ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂOur code needs to call into a Javascript library, but that Javascript library is crashing because it canÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂt find the setTimeout method. Can you investigate?ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ
Are excited to work across multiple platforms with different technologies.
Have experience with:
Kotlin / Java
Or
Swift / Objective-C
Have shipped or helped ship at least one significant app for either iOS or Android.
Are a senior developer who can point to strong experience where youÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂve exemplified the bullet points above.
Bonus Point:


You already use and love YNAB.
Salary will be between $90k and $125k, depending on experience.

And, since our job descriptions are already so long, whatÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs another sentence or twoÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¦

YNAB is an equal opportunity employer. We believe diversity of backgrounds, beliefs, and experiences to be critical to our success and are passionate about creating a welcoming, supportive, and collaborative environment for all employees. All are encouraged to apply as we continue to grow a smart, hard-working, and diverse team who love working together to build something that matters.

254,Manufacturing Software Engineer,Mayfield Robotics,"About the Company:

At Mayfield Robotics, we make home robots that are joyful, useful, and inspiring. We move fast, we like and respect each other, and we have some very big ambitions. And weÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂre still growing.

We operate with all the best aspects of being a startup: independence, speed, transparency, teamwork, and a well-stocked kitchen. We also have the focus and discipline of a company that knows exactly where itÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs going, without the distraction of fundraising (weÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂre wholly owned by a much larger company that loves what weÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂre doing, thinks long term, and mostly leaves us alone). We were founded in February of 2015, and weÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂre based in sunny Redwood City, California - the epicenter of both Silicon Valley and the future of robotics.

About the Role:

Do you like robots? As you know, they still canÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂt manufacture themselves. But if you do well enough at this, you could put yourself out of a job by making that a reality!

MayfieldÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs Manufacturing team is increasing the capacity of our robot factory. We need someone to guide the software facet of building robots to ensure smooth deliveries to our eager customers. The goal is to ensure a smooth production line. This includes making sure the test stations on the line function properly, get updated securely and scale effectively to meet our throughput targets. You will ensure the correct software is put on each robot before it ships to a customer. Additionally, you will be responsible for collecting all the data from all the stations, getting the data into the correct systems and making sure the data is correct and complete so that the complete lifecycle of the robot can be tracked. There is no glory here: If you excel at your job, things will just work.

Come help us meet our excited customers demand for cute, adorable home robots and be on the forefront of mass produced robots.

Responsibilities:

Bridge the gap between MayfieldÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs Manufacturing and Software teams
Help Manufacturing Engineers turn requirements into high-quality software
Document and create a maintainable way to keep manufacturing line up to date and reproducible
Work with Test Engineers to develop reliable subassembly and end-of-line tests
Work with IT Specialists to deploy and maintain our networking infrastructure at the contract manufacturerÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs site
Bake security into the manufacturing and software provisioning processes
Continuously improve, automate, and parallelize assembly line steps in order to reduce cycle time and variability while increasing quality and throughput
25-50% travel to China in order to support manufacturing and deploy software


Required Qualifications:

4+ years of professional software engineering experience with Python, C++, and/or Javascript
Embedded Linux experience (both x86 and ARM architectures)
Basic Linux networking and security experience
Experience developing firmware for microcontrollers (e.g. AVR)
Familiarity with off-the-shelf computer vision tools and libraries (e.g. OpenCV)
The candidate must have a multi-entry Chinese visa, meet the requirements for obtaining one, or not require a visa in order to travel to China


Nice to Have:

Has shipped a robotics, IoT, or high-volume consumer-electronics product
Has experience supporting manufacturing operations or has worked in a factory-facing role
Understanding of data acquisition and signal processing (for example FFT; Fast Fourier Transform)

Job description

WalletHub is a high-growth fintech company based in Washington,  D.C. that is seeking hardworking, like-minded individuals to help us reshape personal finance and make a tangible difference in people's everyday lives. Our fast-paced environment and can do attitude have already earned us several prestigious awards including the Gold Stevie for best financial services website from the American Business Awards and a gold medal as one of the products of the year from the Consumer World Awards.

More specifically, we are harnessing the power of data analytics and artificial intelligence to build the brain of a smart financial advisor, whose services weÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂre offering to everyone for free. The WalletHub brain enables users to make better financial decisions in a fraction of the time with three unique features:


Customized Credit-Improvement Tips: WalletHub identifies improvement opportunities and guides you through the necessary corrections.
Personalized Money-Saving Advice: WalletHubÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs savings brain constantly scours the market for load-lightening opportunities, bringing you only the best deals.
Wallet Surveillance: Personal finance isnÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂt as scary with 24/7 credit monitoring providing backup, notifying you of important credit-report changes.
In addition to the valuable intelligence the brain provides, WalletHub is the first and only service to offer free credit scores and full credit reports that are updated on a daily basis absent of user interaction, rather than weekly or monthly and only when a user logs in. Some other services hang their hats on free credit scores and reports, yet theyÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂre still inferior to what WalletHub considers minor pieces to a much larger puzzle.

274,"Software Engineer, Platform",VigLink,"About VigLink:

At VigLink, we believe the future of marketing lies within the untapped potential of digital content covering commercial products across the Web. We empower influential publishers who produce this content to connect enthusiastic consumers with the products they love from the brands who value them the most. We accomplish this directly through publishersÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ words, without need for an ad.

By identifying commercial products mentioned within a publisherÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs content, VigLink automatically invigorates those terms by transforming them into hyperlinks whose destinations are determined in real-time, advertiser-bid auctions. Yes, hyperlinks, the defining feature of the Web from the very start. The literal ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂHÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ in HTML. Every time a clicked link takes a person from one destination to another, value is created. However, that value has never been fairly priced or available for purchase at scale. Until now.

Founded in 2009, VigLink is located in heart of San Francisco and backed by top investors including Google Ventures, Emergence Capital, and RRE. VigLink manages a publisher network of over 2 million sites and apps, as well as an advertiser network of over 70,000 brands and merchants.

The HashiCorp suite empowers organizations to provision hybrid cloud infrastructure, secure secrets across distributed applications, and run dynamic resources.

At HashiCorp, we value top-notch collaboration and communication skills, both among internal teams and in how we interact with our users. We take care to balance and be responsive to the needs of our open source community as well as our enterprise level customers.

Engineering at HashiCorp is largely a remote team. While prior experience working remotely isn't required, we are looking for team members who perform well given a high level of independence and autonomy.

HashiCorp Terraform is an open source project that enables you to safely and predictably create, change, and improve production infrastructure via the CLI. It codifies APIs into declarative configuration files that can be shared amongst team members, treated as code, edited, reviewed, and versioned.

We want you to contribute to the design, development, and maintenance of Terraform Core, which includes Terraform's graph-based execution engine along with its configuration language, its command line interface, and its plugin protocols. These are the generic behaviors that apply regardless of which provider is in use.

In this role, you can expect to:


Work on issues and improvements for Terraform Core that are critical to the success of HashiCorp customers and the broader community
Help support open source contributors, new and seasoned, with supportive and constructive code review, documentation improvements, and workflow changes
Help craft sometimes-conflicting requirements into a cohesive product by making design tradeoffs and employing pragmatism
You may be a good fit for our team if some of the following apply to you:


You have experience in a lower-level language like Go
You have experience with customer support or open source community support to help interface with the Terraform community
You are familiar and comfortable with common data structures and algorithms
You are familiar with infrastructure management concepts and ecosystem
You have experience using Terraform

292,Senior Data Scientist / Machine Learning Engineer,VigLink,"About VigLink:

At VigLink, we believe the future of marketing lies within the untapped potential of digital content covering commercial products across the Web. We empower influential publishers who produce this content to connect enthusiastic consumers with the products they love from the brands who value them the most. We accomplish this directly through publishersÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ words, without need for an ad.

By identifying commercial products mentioned within a publisherÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs content, VigLink automatically invigorates those terms by transforming them into hyperlinks whose destinations are determined in real-time, advertiser-bid auctions. Yes, hyperlinks, the defining feature of the Web from the very start. The literal ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂHÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ in HTML. Every time a clicked link takes a person from one destination to another, value is created. However, that value has never been fairly priced or available for purchase at scale. Until now.

Founded in 2009, VigLink is located in heart of San Francisco and backed by top investors including Google Ventures, Emergence Capital, and RRE. VigLink manages a publisher network of over 2 million sites and apps, as well as an advertiser network of over 70,000 brands and merchants.

About the role:

VigLink is seeking a Data Scientist or Machine Learning Engineer with strong Hadoop, Hive and SQL skills, and experience creating production-quality code in Python, R, or other related languages. We are looking for folks who enjoy working on a variety of different types of analyses, ranging from ad-hoc ""data wrangling"" tasks through the creation of full-blown programs to calculate business-critical, customer-visible values on an ongoing basis, enjoy thinking through a data problem, understanding the customer needs associated with it, and working on your own and with other developers to create a pragmatic solution.

At VigLink we love go-getters and people who like working in an Agile, best-practices environment - who understand the importance of testable, modular, efficient code, so that's what you write.

Required Qualifications:

Minimum of 3 years experience in relevant analytics tasks with strong Python, R, Matlab, or related language
Experience training and implementing supervised and/or unsupervised learning modelsÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ
Solid understanding of databases and SQL
Capacious curiosity for data and algorithms, and how to apply them to create insight
Experience with Linux/UnixÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂyou are comfortable on the command line
Experience in the e-commerce, web analytics, search, and cloud computing space
BA/BS degree in Computer Science preferred with a strong academic record (MS/PhD or equivalent a plus)

Preferred Qualifications:

NLP experience particularly with concepts such as document classification, named entity recognition/disambiguation, and topic modelling
Experience with Java, or a JVM based language like Scala
Experience with the Hadoop ecosystem, particularly Pig and Hive

A few fun problems we're working on:

Feature Extraction and Context / Product Inference
Identify the commercial context of publisher content, identify the relevance of commercial links to that content, and match relevant destinations to appropriate products / services available across the web.

Statistical Modeling and Prediction of Earnings
Model the performance of our existing publishers and merchants to predict future performance at high granularity.

Large-Data Analytics and Audience Profiling
Develop automated insights that help publishers improve their performance by developing a better understanding of their audiences based on billions of impressions and tens of millions of clicks per week. Do this for thousands of publishers in a scalable and relevant way.

Destination Optimization
Select the most appropriate destination for a commercial link, based on what is best for the viewer and the publisher. Balance estimated publisher earnings (based on earnings per click, location, device type, etc) with viewer relevance and good viewer experience.
Relocation and travel expenses not covered.  

VigLink Values

At VigLink we have a great company culture where mission and values are clear, communicated often, and embraced.

296,Software Engineer,Azavea,"Overview

Azavea is a civic technology firm based in Philadelphia that uses geospatial data to build software and data analytics for the web.  As a B Corporation, our mission is to use advanced geospatial technology for civic, social, and environmental impact. Most of our work deals with local governments, non-profit organizations, and academic or federal research projects.  We build custom web applications, perform geospatial analysis, and contribute to open source projects.  Our engineers work across the technology stack, from modern browser-based front-ends to robust service-based backends residing on scalable infrastructure.

We are looking for a Software Engineer who is passionate about building and operating applications that will have a positive impact. Ideal candidates are interested in public service, but not necessarily in working for a government or a non-profit organization.

WeÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂre excited about what we do, weÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂre growing, and we hope you will join us.

Skills & Requirements

Azavea has five software teams, all of which develop web software for processing and visualizing geospatial data.  The teams differ in terms of the specific projects they develop and whether they are primarily product or service focussed. The GeoTrellis team develops an open source software framework that enables low latency, distributed processing of geospatial data; the majority of our work is currently funded by the U.S. Federal government. The project is based on Scala and Apache Spark. It is used in many types of web applications, including processing satellite imagery, climate change, precision agriculture, public transit travel-sheds, and watershed modeling. GeoTrellis is a member of the Eclipse FoundationÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs LocationTech working group. A significant focus of the past year has been developing Python Bindings in an effort to expand the pool of developers that can benefit from GeoTrellis. GeoTrellis is growing, and we need your help to expand the framework and make it more useful to other developers.

What YouÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂll Do
Build scalable back-end software where performance is critical.
Implement new features, algorithms, data processing operations, benchmarks and tests for a large Scala-based software framework.
Engage in multidisciplinary work that applies an agile process (scrum board, daily stand-ups and two-week iterations) to design, architecture, development, testing and deployment.
Support the development of an open source community around the GeoTrellis project.
Contribute to both a growing company and to the open source communities that support our work.

You should
Demonstrate fluency with at least one functional programming language such as Scala, Clojure or Haskell.
Be able to adapt and lean in order to keep innovating on a cutting edge open source project.
Have experience with Amazon Web Service  or another cloud-based architecture.
Interested in working with a small, collaborative team on meaningful projects.
Get excited about contributing to a large, complex open source project.

You get extra points for
Experience with Spark, Akka, or other Scala-based distributed processing frameworks.
Having worked with distributed data processing frameworks, like Hadoop, Amazon MR, etc.
Demonstrating your open source or other community service contributions.
Strong background in algorithm development where performance is critical.

YouÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂll notice that we donÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂt cite N years of experience or a Computer Science as requirements.  Formal credentials like these are valuable, but we are primarily looking for people who have gained real-world experience successfully building sophisticated web applications.  

Office and Benefits

Our Philadelphia headquarters is located in a brightly lit office on the 5th floor of a converted factory building in the Callowhill neighborhood, a short walk from Center City, the Reading Terminal Market, and SEPTA subway and regional rail stations. For bicyclists, we have in-house bike parking, a shower and lockers.  The office itself is assembled as an open office plan with several smaller rooms for team meetings and concentration time.  You get your own desk with a high-end Linux workstation or Apple laptop and extra monitors.  We have flex-time to deal with personal stuff, and most people work a 40 - 45 hour week on a regular schedule.  After the first six months, our staff can also spend up to 10% of their time on an open source, professional development, or R&D project.  Recent 10% time projects include experiments with machine learning, Python 3, Reactive Native, and various forms of serverless processing with Amazon Lambda.

We offer a salary commensurate with skills and experience and a benefits package that includes:
Fully subsidized health care, dental, prescription plan, including for spouse/partner and children
Fully subsidized life and long term disability insurance, plus voluntary short term disability insurance
